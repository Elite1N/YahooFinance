      "EVs were once the future in the US. Now, they're at risk of short-circuiting.\n",
      "Policy changes, tariffs, and supply chain disruptions have sparked warnings of an EV deep freeze.\n",
      "One analyst told BI that the US was at risk of falling behind just as China's EV giants race ahead.\n",
      "Electric vehicles are facing a perfect storm in the US — and it's threatening to throw the industry into a deep freeze.\n",
      "A nightmare combination of policy changes, tariffs, and supply chain upheavals has prompted automakers that once set ambitious EV targets to revise their strategies, lay off workers, and double down on hybrids and gasoline vehicles.\n",
      "CEOs have been sounding the alarm bells for a while.\n",
      "The end of the $7,500 tax credit for new electric vehicles in September prompted Ford boss Jim Farley to predict that EV market share in the US would nearly halve to around 5% in the near term, while Tesla CEO Elon Musk warned in July that the company could face a \"rough few quarters\" as federal support for electric cars was rolled back.\n",
      "The initial signs suggest they may have been right. After hitting a record in September as buyers rushed to beat the tax credit deadline, EV sales collapsed nearly 49% in October, according to data from Cox Automotive.\n",
      "Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Cox Automotive's director of industry insights, told Business Insider that the rollback of government support would \"shift the timeline\" for EV adoption.\n",
      "She estimated that EVs would now make up around 24% of new car sales by 2030, far from the aspirational target of half set by the Biden administration four years ago.\n",
      "\"We're not going to see a huge growth in the next couple of years,\" Valdez Streaty said, adding that a lack of affordable EVs was still the main barrier for adoption.\n",
      "With the outlook for EV demand looking decidedly chilly, carmakers are tightening their belts.\n",
      "GM announced plans to lay off 1,750 workers last month, citing slowing electric vehicle demand after taking a $1.6 billion charge over changes in its EV strategy. Rivian also announced layoffs last month, equivalent to 4.5% of its workforce.\n",
      "The global auto industry is still reeling from the impact of US tariffs and has faced a pileup of supply chain headaches, including a temporary shortage of crucial chips and a fire at a major Ford aluminum supplier.\n",
      "\"The whole combination of everything in the water right now is causing some automakers to either cancel or delay electric vehicle programs,\" Stephanie Brinley, an associate director at S&P Global, told Business Insider, adding that the impact would leave consumers with fewer choices over the next few years.\n",
      "The combined effect of the tariffs and the EV slowdown has led some automakers to pull electric models from the US market entirely.\n",
      "Nissan said in September it would stop selling its Ariya SUV in the US, a week before Honda cut its Acura ZDX electric crossover due to what it called \"market conditions.\"\n",
      "Meanwhile, Jeep has put some planned EVs for the US on hold, while Ram has canceled its all-electric Ram 1500 REV and is focusing on a plug-in hybrid pickup instead. Earlier this month, The Wall Street Journal reported that Ford was considering scrapping its flagship F-150 Lightning electric truck.\n",
      "Facing heat from all directions, some automakers are doubling down on a tried-and-tested strategy: build more hybrids and combustion engine vehicles.\n",
      "Toyota announced a nearly $1 billion investment this month to boost hybrid production in the US, while GM unveiled plans to build several new gas-powered vehicles in June as part of a $4 billion manufacturing overhaul.\n",
      "These efforts have received a boost from the Trump administration, which opened the door for carmakers to sell combustion engine vehicles for longer by gutting emissions rules that levied massive fines on automakers who failed to sell enough EVs.\n",
      "Speaking at a tech conference hosted by Barclays last week, Ford CFO Sherry House said she expected a \"contraction\" in the US electric vehicle market, adding the company would likely respond by investing in gas-powered vehicles like its Mustang and Raptor lines.\n",
      "\"We're going to be leaning into these products that are just passion products. I mean, these are vehicles that people love,\" she said.\n",
      "One company that is confident it can ride out the EV winter is Tesla.\n",
      "Musk may have warned of a bumpy road in the summer, but the billionaire has struck a more confident tone since then, telling investors this month he expects the company's AI and robotaxi initiatives to vastly boost demand for its vehicles.\n",
      "Tesla also weathered the steep drop-off in EV sales in October better than its rivals, with deliveries falling 35.3% month-over-month compared to nearly 50% overall per Cox Automotive data.\n",
      "The Texas-based company introduced cut-price versions of its most popular vehicles last month following the loss of the tax credit.\n",
      "However, Tesla has not launched a new vehicle since the Cybertruck in 2023, and Musk has been clear that the company's future lies in its Optimus robot and Cybercab robotaxi, both of which he said are set to begin mass production next year.\n",
      "Last year, the billionaire said it would be \"pointless\" for Tesla to build a more affordable non-robotaxi EV, suggesting the company's future may be less dependent on conventional vehicles.\n",
      "\"Tesla feels like a company that is maybe changing some of its direction in terms of where it expects its revenue to come from in five or 10 years,\" said Brinley.\n",
      "Other automakers are racing to fill the affordable EV gap, with GM launching a new version of the Chevy Bolt starting at just under $30,000 last month and Ford teasing an electric truck set to roll out in 2027 at a similar price tag.\n",
      "With electric vehicles still around $10,000 more expensive on average than their gas-powered counterparts, Valdez Streaty said that more affordable options are needed for EVs to shake off their winter blues and become mainstream in the US.\n",
      "Without them, she warned that the US risks ceding the rest of the globe to China's EV makers. The likes of BYD have crushed foreign automakers in China, where more than half of new car sales are electric, and are now expanding rapidly in a host of global markets.\n",
      "\"The world's going electric, right? The Chinese players are continuing to innovate and come out with new products that are inexpensive and high-tech,\" Valdez Streaty said.\n",
      "\"With the delay in growing that market share in the US, I think there's a risk the US could fall further behind,\" she added.\n",

      "Wall Street is relying on the Supreme Court to protect the Fed. Is that wishful thinking?\n",
      "CNN Business \n",
      "No tickers found\n",
      "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/wall-street-relying-supreme-court-080058641.html\n",
      "Analysis by Bryan Mena, CNN\n",
      "Sat, November 29, 2025 at 3:00 PM GMT+7\n",
      "Wall Street barely blinked at President Donald Trump’s attacks on the Federal Reserve this year. But its confidence could be shaken with an upcoming Supreme Court ruling.\n",
      "Trump has launched an intense pressure campaign against the Fed during his second term, frequently demanding interest-rate cuts and threatening to fire Chair Jerome Powell. The central bank has lowered interest rates twice this year, in September and October, and has another opportunity to cut rates in December.\n",
      "Yet investors remain confident in the Fed’s ability to fight inflation — at least according to measures such as long-term interest rates on US Treasuries and inflation expectations.\n",
      "Their faith hinges on a Supreme Court case over Trump’s efforts to fire Fed Governor Lisa Cook, a Biden appointee and the first Black woman to serve as a Fed governor.\n",
      "If Trump wins, the Fed’s vaunted independence to set interest rates without political interference could crumble.\n",
      "But Wall Street seems to believe the Supreme Court will ultimately opt to keep the central bank independent. Markets also seem to believe that none of the names floated to succeed Powell as Fed chair when his term ends in May pose a threat in that regard, either.\n",
      "“For now, Wall Street is very comfortable with Fed independence,” said James Ragan, director of wealth management research at financial services firm DA Davidson.\n",
      "Just three days after Trump said he fired Cook in August — the first time a president has tried to fire a Fed governor in the central bank’s near-112-year history — the S&P 500 closed at a record high as other major stock indexes pushed higher.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the yield on the 10-year US Treasury note, a benchmark used for the rates on various loans, has steadily declined since the spring, when Trump began to threaten firing Powell. That means investors don’t see interest rates getting out of control in the next decade, a sign of confidence in the Fed.\n",
      "Indeed, long-term market-based inflation expectations, which capture Wall Street’s faith in the Fed’s ability to fight price increases, have remained in check throughout the year.\n",
      "But fears of growing government deficits have driven up so-called term premiums, the extra yield investors demand for holding long-term bonds over shorter ones. Investors say concerns about Fed independence have also played a role — albeit a minor one — in the uptick.\n",
      "The court has scheduled oral arguments in late January to determine whether Trump has the power to fire Cook. The president has cited unproven allegations of mortgage fraud. The Justice Department is investigating, but she has not been charged. Earlier this month, Cook’s lawyers said the allegations are “baseless” and urged the department to drop its inquiry.\n",
      "In a separate case in May, the justices said in an unsigned opinion that Trump could keep Gwynne Wilcox, whom he fired from the National Labor Relations Board, off the NLRB while she continues fighting in court to reverse her termination.\n",
      "But SCOTUS specifically said that decision doesn’t impact the Fed.\n",
      "“Markets took a great deal of comfort from that,” Randall Kroszner, a former Fed governor, said at a central banking conference on October 31 hosted by the Peterson Institute for Economics (PIIE). He said investors “believe that the Supreme Court will take a reasonable and balanced approach” in the Cook case.\n",
      "Investors are also closely watching Trump’s nomination of the next Fed chair. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who has led the search, revealed a shortlist of five people from the White House, the Fed and the private sector. The list includes National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett as well as Fed governors Christopher Waller and Michelle Bowman.\n",
      "Bessent told CNBC recently that Trump’s announcement could come around Christmas.\n",
      "“Markets still seem to be fairly confident Fed independence will prevail, and I think this is in part because of the names that we saw for Fed chairman were reasonable,” Francesco Bianchi, an economics professor and monetary policy scholar at Johns Hopkins University, said at the PIIE conference.\n",

      "Following a £30bn raid in this year’s Budget, Rachel Reeves has refused to rule out the possibility of introducing more tax rises next year. The Chancellor, who has been accused by the Tories of breaking Labour’s manifesto pledge not to put up taxes on working people, hinted there could be more to come in next year’s Budget.\n",
      "Many readers expressed outrage at Labour’s spending and asked whether any cuts had actually been made during her announcement on Wednesday. Genevieve Holl-Allen, The Telegraph’s political correspondent; Sam Brodbeck, our Money editor; Szu Ping Chan, our economics editor; and Camilla Tominey, an associate editor, joined you in the comments to discuss the political fallout.\n",
      "One reader, Rick Tuck, wondered about Reeves’s spending.\n",
      "He asked: “Has Reeves cut actual spending ANYWHERE?”\n",
      "Genevieve Holl-Allen said: “It is definitely true to say, Rick, that she has cut spending by even less than she said that she would – this is chiefly evident in welfare. Benefits spending will be £16bn a year higher in 2029 than planned, and the welfare bill is now expected to rise to £406.2bn in the next five years.\n",
      "“Rachel Reeves is keen to try and make efficiency savings in the public sector and hopes that AI might be able to save money too.\n",
      "“But she is desperate to not be accused of a return to austerity by voters and backbenchers. This means any big cuts in services appear a political impossibility for her.”\n",
      "Many readers, including Frank Johnson, questioned what exactly the Chancellor thought would help working people and the middle classes in Wednesday’s Budget.\n",
      "He said: “So, she’s going to put money in our pockets – but we all have to pay more. How does that make us better off?”\n",
      "Sam Brodbeck said: “You make a good point Frank! I’m not sure anyone will feel better off (apart from people with more than three kids who are on benefits perhaps). We got confirmation the triple lock will boost state pensions by around £550 a year but more of that boost will be lost to income tax.”\n",
      "Reeves mentioned Liz Truss more than once during her Budget speech and Richard O’Brien wondered how much longer they could refer to her tenure.\n",
      "He said: “Hiya, Sam, Labour keep blaming Liz Truss. Given that 90pc of her mini-Budget was reversed, does this not seem to be somewhat of a poor excuse for the Government to use?”\n",
      "Sam Brodbeck said: “Yes I noticed this ... I think she was mentioned three times yesterday. It is a poor excuse but any party other than the Tories will mention her tenure as much as possible for the next decade I imagine!”\n",
      "Mark Time questioned the Chancellor’s economics.\n",
      "He said: “I wonder what economic principles [Reeves] is using where she is fast losing control of inflation and so she taxes savings to increase minimum wages, and welfare payments to ensure the welfare lifestyle is viable?”\n",
      "Szu Ping Chan said: “It’s ideology. On the minimum wage, for example, Labour keeps coming back to the same old arguments. People who were bleating in 1999 about its introduction were wrong. People who were bleating when George Osborne upgraded it were wrong. But this time is different. Paying a teenager the same rate as someone in their late twenties is just a recipe for youth unemployment. Meanwhile, the inflation gremlin gets us all.”\n",
      "Reader Humpty Dumpty suggested Reeves is making it up as she goes along.\n",
      "They said: “She has ‘gambled’ on a better-than-currently-predicted economic outcome over the next five years, and has attempted to create the ‘headroom’ to allow cuts prior to the next election (without this the Labour Party are ‘doomed, I say doomed’!).\n",
      "“If, however, things are as bad as predicted, then she has taxed us (in her mind) correctly. I think she will continue to ‘make it up as she goes along’ while the party tolerates her in the job!”\n",
      "Szu Ping Chan replied: “Gamble is the right word. Richard Hughes, the boss of the OBR, said this morning that there wasn’t a single measure in this Budget that was likely to move the dial on growth. Headroom of £22bn is still wafer-thin for a £3trn economy. She talks the talk, but when it comes to walking the walk, I feel like things are going in reverse.”\n",
      "Labour backbenchers have been vociferous in their opposition to some of Reeves’s policy proposals and readers like Dylan Ratcliffe wondered how much pressure she is under.\n",
      "He asked: “Not that it matters, but do we think Reeves is making such decisions because she wants to, or because she’s been hustled into it by her backbenchers?”\n",
      "Genevieve Holl-Allen said: “A pretty inescapable conclusion from this Budget, Dylan, is that one of the bigger spending measures announced came from sustained backbench pressure: the scrapping of the two-child benefit cap.\n",
      "“There has been a clamour from Labour backbenchers to remove this limit pretty much since Labour took office.\n",
      "“Reeves and Starmer were standing firm on this, trying to show that they were strong on the economy and could not be cowed into making decisions they couldn’t pay for.\n",
      "“But as the Government has grown weaker and more unpopular, the Chancellor and PM have had to work a bit harder to keep those backbenchers on side, especially when major figures like deputy Labour leader Lucy Powell, and once-mooted leadership challenger Andy Burnham, have made it clear it must go as soon as possible.\n",
      "“And even those sympathetic to Labour are saying that the rises in tax are to pay for welfare. Benefits spending will be £16bn a year higher in 2029 than the Chancellor had planned in the spring.”\n",
      "Reader Sarwan Singh wondered how long Reeves and Starmer can last after this Budget.\n",
      "They asked: “The litmus test of this Budget is if Reeves and Starmer can last longer than Truss and kamikaze Kwarteng … and how the bond and gilt markets react. Can they last longer than a lettuce?”\n",
      "Genevieve Holl-Allen replied: “One of the problems that Reeves and the Government has faced over the last few weeks is all the leaks, which the deputy speaker yesterday said were the worst of any previous Budget.\n",
      "“But what this does mean is that the markets (and the public) have known a great deal about what to expect from the Chancellor, unlike the big shock of the mini-Budget with its £45bn of tax cuts. That has meant a slightly less dramatic response than in September 2022.\n",
      "“The Chancellor and the Prime Minister may last longer than a lettuce, but they certainly aren’t out of the woods.”\n",
      "Labour has changed its mind over many policies and readers like Mel Shaw wondering what the plan exactly is.\n",
      "They said: “What is the plan? Reeves must think she has one. Can anyone work out what it is?”\n",
      "Genevieve Holl-Allen said: “I was struck by something that George Osborne, the former Tory chancellor, said on his Political Currency podcast last night, which is that this Budget was an ‘off-strategy’ fiscal event for Reeves, and I think he’s right.\n",
      "“The Chancellor at the previous Budget had said that she would not be coming back for more tax, and even said that she would not continue the freeze in income tax thresholds as it would ‘hurt working people’. But she isn’t getting the growth she wanted, and the welfare reforms she wanted to see through were scuppered by her backbenchers, so she had to find another path.\n",
      "“It does seem that her plan with this Budget now is to create as much headroom as possible, of around £22bn by the end of the current Parliament, so that she has a bigger buffer zone to changing fiscal forecasts.”\n",
      "Readers like Phillip Norris also asked why Reeves refuses to take accountability.\n",
      "He said: “I just love the spin given by her: the tax free amount was frozen by the Conservatives until 2028 — as though it was a very bad thing — then next breath she increases it by three years to 2031!\n",
      "“The blame game began in earnest as soon as she could mention it. So the whole problem is Trump, Truss, Brexit, Reform and Uncle Tom Cobley and all. Anyone, anything other than themselves, because it would mean they would need to take responsibility and accountability.”\n",
      "Genevieve Holl-Allen replied: “Rachel Reeves has continued to point back to the previous 14 years of Conservative government, in particular Liz Truss’s mini-Budget and the handling of Brexit, to explain Britain’s current financial woes.\n",
      "“That rhetoric is likely to have helped them win the general election, with voters fed up with the Tories, but you have to wonder how much more patience the electorate will have if they continue to see their finances stretched and their taxes high after many months of a Labour administration.\n",
      "“The 2026 local elections and elections in Holyrood and the Senedd might give us the answer.”\n",
      "James Turner asked if the Chancellor is aware that she has broken her manifesto pledge.\n",
      "He said: “I’m surprised that nobody has pointed out to Reeves that she has raised tax rates – on savings interest, property income, and dividends.”\n",
      "Camilla Tominey replied: “The Telegraph has pointed that out loudly and clearly.\n",
      "“The figures are clear: £26bn of extra taxes, with the tax take up to 42.4 as a percentage of GDP after the end of this parliament. There is no other way to say it: she’s taxing working people to pay for new benefits plus an inflation-linked welfare hike. It’s a clear manifesto breach.”\n",
      "Phillip Marques questioned when the Government will cease borrowing and begin addressing the national debt.\n",
      "He said: “This Government did not mention anything about reducing the £2.6tn deficit we have. Do you think they will actually start paying the debt down anytime soon rather than keep borrowing massively?”\n",
      "Camilla Tominey said: “Rachel Reeves said yesterday: ‘The path of our deficit reduction remains broadly the same as in spring.’\n",
      "“Back then, she announced we would be moving from a deficit of £36.1bn in 2025-26 and £13.4bn in 2026-27 ... to a surplus of £6.0bn in 2027-28, £7.1bn in 2028-29, and a surplus of £9.9bn in 2029-30. She said: ‘That means that we are continuing to meet the Stability Rule two years early.’\n",
      "“But debt is a different thing. It’s way too high but it will come down slightly by the end of the parliament. It’s forecast to be 83.3pc in 26/27, 83.6pc in 27/28, 83.7pc in 28/29…falling to 83.0pc in 29/30 and 82.2pc in 30/31.\n",
      "“NB Debt on this scale is completely unsustainable. It was below 40 as a pc of GDP from 1993 to 2008 when it shot up – and now remains at more than double what it was.”\n",

      "XRP once again defended the critical $2.17 support zone despite an 18% monthly drawdown, bouncing into tight consolidation as analysts identify a potential Elliott Wave reversal setup that may mark the end of the corrective cycle.\n",
      "XRP endured a volatile session after spending the last month under heavy selling pressure. Market sentiment softened further earlier in the week before stabilizing as the token approached long-standing trend support.\n",
      "The session’s most notable development came at 15:00 UTC when trading volume exploded to 202.7 million tokens — 158% above average — propelling XRP briefly to $2.28 before immediate rejection.\n",
      "Technical analysts note that recent price action aligns with the possible completion of the asset’s broader corrective structure.\n",
      "Elliott Wave specialists argue the final leg of the ABC correction likely reached technical exhaustion near $1.88 earlier in the month, a region aligning with major Fibonacci extensions that historically mark cycle lows.\n",
      "XRP traded in a whipsaw $0.11 range between $2.17 and $2.28 throughout Tuesday’s session.\n",
      "After the heavy rejection from $2.28, price retreated toward the $2.17 floor before stabilizing in a narrow $2.18–$2.19 band.\n",
      "Late-session action showed constructive accumulation, with XRP climbing from $2.183 to $2.188 as volume spikes at 02:12 and 02:15 (387K and 427K) supported the recovery.\n",
      "The bounce off $2.17 and the ability to hold above $2.18 suggest early rebuilding of bullish structure after the earlier rejection.\n",
      "XRP’s defensive performance around $2.17 signals buyers are still active around key demand zones despite the monthly decline.\n",
      "The declining peaks of the past week still define a descending resistance structure, but multi-stage consolidation above $2.184 signals accumulation rather than continued distribution.\n",
      "The $2.22 region now acts as the pivot for broader trend reversal. Elliott Wave analysis suggests XRP has completed its Wave-4 corrective structure, with the sequence bottoming near $1.88 at the 161.8% Fibonacci extension — a level commonly associated with the end of deep corrective waves.\n",
      "A sustained close above $2.22 is considered the technical trigger for the start of Wave-5 expansion.\n",
      "If validated, long-term Fibonacci projections place the extended upside target near $5.85 (261.8% extension), though XRP must first reclaim $2.22, then $2.28 to confirm breakout strength.\n",
      "Volume behavior supports the reversal thesis: heavy buying during the $2.28 test followed by smaller, persistent accumulation near $2.18 suggests positioning ahead of potential breakout attempts.\n",
      "XRP sits at a pivotal inflection point. Holding $2.17 is essential for preserving the emerging reversal structure.\n",
      "A close above $2.22 would signal the first legitimate bullish confirmation in weeks and potentially activate broader Wave-5 targets.\n",
      "Failure below $2.17 reopens $2.10 and $1.98, invalidating the bullish count.Given strengthening ETF flows, recovering intraday accumulation, and the possibility of a completed corrective wave, XRP’s trajectory over the next 48–72 hours may determine whether the token begins a new macro expansion phase — or re-enters deeper consolidation.\n",

      "Connie Loizos\n",
      "Sat, November 29, 2025 at 1:17 PM GMT+7\n",
      "When its season ended early this month, Angel City FC finished 11th out of 13 teams, a disappointing result for the Los Angeles soccer franchise that venture capitalist Kara Nortman co-founded in 2020. But the season’s struggles tell only part of a much larger story that’s reshaping how investors think about women’s sports.\n",
      "Despite its lackluster on-field performance, Angel City itself has become a case study (including literally, inside Harvard Business School) in how to best construct a women’s sports property. The team’s celebrity ownership group, including Natalie Portman and Serena Williams, has helped generate nearly unprecedented buzz. The franchise has also been savvy about sponsorships, breaking records before players kicked a ball.\n",
      "“We went from zero to $30 million in revenue. We sold out games. We built something people didn’t think was possible,” Nortman reflected in an interview last month, pointing to Angel City’s commercial success from the very outset of the team’s formation. “That really led to the formation of Monarch.”\n",
      "That commercial success, not trophies, became the blueprint for Monarch Collective, the $250 million fund Nortman launched in 2023, which has become the first investment vehicle focused exclusively on women’s sports. While its origin story may be rooted in a team that has yet to win a playoff game, Monarch’s portfolio and influence have expanded far beyond Angel City’s training facility in Thousand Oaks, California.\n",
      "The fund now holds stakes in three other National Women’s Soccer League clubs: San Diego Wave, Boston Legacy FC (debuting next year), and its newest investment, announced earlier this month, FC Viktoria Berlin. The deal for 38% of the German club, makes Monarch the first foreign investor to acquire a stake in a German women’s soccer team.\n",
      "It’s a diverse collection that reflects Nortman’s conviction that women’s sports have reached an inflection point, regardless of any single team’s fortunes. The numbers support her optimism, too.\n",
      "“The overall men’s sports market globally is estimated to be about half a trillion dollars,” Nortman explains. “The women’s sports market, when we started Monarch in 2023, was thought to be about half a billion dollars. It’s now closer to $3 billion.”\n",
      "Tapping into that growth requires a different playbook than men’s sports, Nortman says. It’s not a simple rinse-and-repeat. “Like, how many men’s team owners are thinking about parachuting Sephora boxes from rafters? Or having at [a New York] Liberty [WNBA game] a Fenty cam for putting on your [Fenty] lipstick, or Angel City having a Hello Kitty collab night where people can’t figure out how to get their hands on the merch before it sells out?”\n",
      "Angel City’s innovative approach to marketing and partnerships helped it build so much excitement that in the fall of last year, power couple Bob Iger and Willow Bay acquired a majority stake in it for $250 million, making it the most valuable women’s sports franchise in the world.\n",
      "For Nortman, who left Upfront Ventures and more traditional venture capital to focus full-time on women’s sports, Angel City’s commercial achievements have continued to validate Monarch’s thesis. Though there’s current tension – certainly in the sports press, at least – between Angel City’s business success and its on-field performance, the team has inarguably proven that women’s sports can generate serious revenue with the right pieces in place.\n",
      "Now, as with any successful new endeavor, the question is: can the momentum last? Nortman is acutely aware that women’s sports has seen promising moments evaporate before. She frequently references a striking historical parallel from 1920, when 60,000 people showed up in Liverpool, England, to watch the Dick, Kerr Ladies play football, which is a bigger crowd than most Premier League games draw today. The next year, the English Football Association banned women from playing, and the sport essentially disappeared for decades.\n",
      "“Everyone gets to wake up and become the discoverer of women’s sports when they do,” Nortman says. “But it takes consistent, hard work to get that to play out into consistency.”\n",
      "That hard work, she argues, requires more than just riding waves of attention from breakout stars like Caitlin Clark or Angel Reese. It demands systematic investment in infrastructure, governance, and operations – the unglamorous work of building sustainable businesses.\n",
      "This is where Monarch’s approach diverges from typical venture capital. Rather than making passive bets on dozens of startups, Monarch is taking concentrated positions in a handful of teams and leagues, then getting deeply involved in operations. The fund describes its strategy as “venture-like markets” with “growth equity or private equity-like” risk management.\n",
      "“We show up alongside control owners and add a lot of operational value,” Nortman explains. The goal is to help teams reach breakeven or profitability on their core operations, positioning them to benefit as higher-margin media revenue grows.\n",
      "Monarch’s investment interest extend beyond soccer. The fund is more broadly focused on what Nortman calls sports with “no product-market risk,” meaning established formats with proven audiences.\n",
      "“Is this a sport people like to watch on their computer or television?” she asks. “There are participatory sports, like pickleball, but are people going to sit home and create an event out of watching it?”\n",
      "Indeed, while Monarch has stakes right now in four “football” clubs, it’s interested, too, in women’s basketball, golf, and tennis – sports with substantial media revenue potential, along with existing infrastructure.\n",
      "The firm’s current limited partners include Melinda French Gates, former Netflix executives, and other wealthy individuals, and interest in its mission seems to be growing. For one thing, Monarch’s debut fund of $250 million is substantially more than the $100 million that Nortman and her co-founder – Jasmine Robinson, a former investor with the sports-, media-, gaming-, and fitness-focused growth stage firm Causeway – initially planned to raise. She says the increased size reflects the market’s rapid maturation during Monarch’s fundraising period.\n",
      "“When we started raising the fund, nine out of 10 conversations were, ‘Yeah, we don’t think [women’s] basketball is really a thing,'” Nortman says, recalling a “lot of skepticism around it.” Then came Caitlin Clark’s meteoric rise, the WNBA’s record-breaking viewership, and suddenly basketball became the hottest sector in women’s sports.\n",
      "That growing interest validates Nortman’s thesis that women’s sports investment isn’t about finding the single perfect team but about supporting an ecosystem where multiple franchises can thrive. Some will win championships. Some will struggle competitively but succeed commercially. The key is having enough capital and operational expertise distributed across the market to weather individual setbacks.\n",
      "Already, Angel City appears to be inspiring other ownership groups. “You started having other teams – Kansas City, Bay FC, Washington D.C. Spirit – with female-led ownership groups come in and show they could build a real P&L,” Nortman notes. Whether intentionally or not, Angel City became a template.\n",
      "As women’s sports enters what feels like a sustained boom period — the Golden State Valkyries just played their first WNBA next season, the NWSL is expanding, media rights deals are growing — Nortman remains cautiously optimistic about whether this moment will prove different from past surges in interest.\n",
      "The key, she argues, lies in the fundamentals: strong league governance, owner commitment, infrastructure investment, and building genuine community connections. Media attention creates opportunity; operational excellence makes it sustainable.\n",
      "“Every spike is an opportunity to create a consistent experience around it,” Nortman says. “You have to look at all the underlying criteria to see where it’s likely to stick around.”\n",

      "Bitcoin’s rebound is starting to show its first meaningful sign of U.S. bid-side strength in weeks, with the Coinbase Premium Index turning positive after spending nearly a month below zero.\n",
      "The shift comes as BTC hovers around the $91,000 level in Asian morning hours Saturday.\n",
      "The premium — which tracks the price spread between Coinbase and the global market — acts as a read on U.S. capital flows in previous cycles. A negative print typically signals domestic outflows or risk aversion among U.S. institutions. A sustained positive print, by contrast, tends to coincide with ETF-driven buying and renewed dollar liquidity.\n",
      "Thursday marked the first time since late October that Coinbase spot prices traded consistently above global averages.\n",
      "Flows line up with the move. Stablecoin balances on Binance hit a record $51.1 billion in November, suggesting fresh firepower waiting on the sidelines. Options desks report a reset in positioning, with GSR flagging the clearance of speculative longs and a “market ready for growth” setup as skew and downside demand ease off local extremes.\n",
      "In separate notes earlier this week, research firms Kronos and Presto characterized the recent bounce as a standard oversold recovery following two weeks of leveraged wipeouts.\n",
      "Still, BTC remains pinned between two critical levels. FxPro’s Alex Kuptsikevich warned that $90,000 — a key reaction zone earlier this year — may now act as resistance, with bulls needing a firm break above $95,000 to reclaim trend.\n",
      "A drop below $87,000 risks reopening the path toward $80,000 and extending November’s capitulation phase.\n",
      "Meanwhile, he sentiment index has climbed to 25, exiting extreme fear but not yet signaling a full shift in psychology. Only one in seven major tokens posted gains over the past day, indicative of how narrow the rebound remains despite a crypto market cap still hovering near $3.1 trillion.\n",

      "The European Commission has been under pressure to secure long-term financing for Kyiv. Its most likely option — a €140bn “reparation loan” backed by immobilised Russian state assets — has drawn criticism from Euroclear, the main custodian of the funds.\n",
      "According to the Financial Times, Euroclear chief executive Valérie Urbain warned in a letter that “the resultant risk premium will lead to a sustained increase in European sovereign bond spreads, raising borrowing costs for all member states”.\n",
      "The concern centres on whether investors view the scheme as amounting to confiscation, which is prohibited under international law. Any perception that foreign reserves held in Europe could be at risk might undermine trust in European financial systems, driving up bond yields.\n",
      "Yet analysts interviewed by Euronews Business say the current proposal carries far less risk than the EU’s original move in 2022 to freeze Russian central-bank assets — an action that caused only a brief shift in bond markets.\n",
      "Robert Timper, chief strategist on the Global Fixed Income Strategy team at BCA Research, said: “I don’t expect much of a market reaction to this, so there won’t be any cost to governments in terms of a higher debt service cost.”\n",
      "He continued: “The immobilisation of Russian assets in 2022 was a first and is what mattered for asset owners, as it meant that they lost access to these assets”. He claimed: “What ultimately is done with these assets should have a much smaller effect.”\n",
      "The EU froze billions of euros of Russian assets on 28 February 2022, four days after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n",
      "Nicolas Véron, senior fellow at the Brussels-based think tank Bruegel, said: “It was a constraint put on the Russian reserves and therefore a demonstration to the world that, given the circumstances, the EU was willing to put big constraints on reserves held on its territory.” He added: “That didn't rock global markets.”\n",
      "Capital Economics similarly argued that fears of a broad retreat by foreign central banks or sovereign wealth funds from European markets are overstated. “Even if there is some loss of confidence, the impact would likely be small as there is a limited range of liquid, high-quality assets that central banks can invest in outside Western financial markets,” it wrote in a recent report.\n",
      "Concerning the shifting trends in the bond market, Timper added that since the immobilisation of the Russian assets in 2022, “we have observed a broad shift by central banks, especially in China and emerging markets, to gold as a reserve asset. This trend is likely to continue, but was already underway before the recent discussions around the use of Russian assets.” He expects this diversification trend to continue but added that so far this “has had little effect on sovereign bonds”.\n",

      "What is the reparations loan for Ukraine and why is the EU stuck with the plan?\n",
      "While the details haven’t been released, Capital Economics said in their report that Euroclear would use the cash it holds on behalf of the Russian Central Bank (CBR) to invest in a long-dated, zero-coupon EU bond. Euroclear’s assets would change from cash balances to an EU bond, but its liability to the CBR would remain unchanged. This is key to holding up the law, which prohibits confiscation.\n",
      "The proceeds from the bond would then be used by the EU to lend to Ukraine.\n",
      "As Euronews reported earlier, Ukraine would be asked to repay the loan only after Russia ends its war of aggression and agrees to compensate for the damages caused. After that, the Commission would repay Euroclear, and Euroclear would repay Russia, completing the circle. The Commission insists this is not confiscation.\n",
      "The loan would be guaranteed by the participating member states, who step in if there is not sufficient reimbursement of the loan. According to the current plans, Russia would be able to recover the assets if it agreed to pay reparations, but that is seen as virtually impossible.\n",
      "CEO of Euroclear Valérie Urbain said in her letter that forcing Euroclear to invest in “zero-interest tailored-debt instrument funding” in order to enact the scheme would be seen as confiscation by Russia, leading to retaliation and potential legal challenges that Euroclear should be covered for.\n",
      "Bruegel's Véron agreed that the main threat comes from Russia’s response: “This is not a confiscation… but there will be Russian propaganda saying it is a confiscation.” He added: “It's not outlandish to imagine that if the reparations loan is decided, Russia will do something that may be detrimental to the global markets.”\n",
      "Capital Economics also cautioned that tit-for-tat measures could carry economic costs, noting that Moscow has already complicated Western companies’ efforts to exit the Russian market.\n",

      "In an interview with Europe Today, European commissioner for economy and productivity Valdis Dombrovskis said a reparation loan backed by frozen Russian assets is “what can provide sizeable support for Ukraine without putting additional and substantial fiscal burden on the EU or its member states”.\n",
      "Véron expects the plan to be finalised by the end of the year, with disbursements potentially starting in the first quarter of 2026, pending parliamentary approvals in several member states.\n",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said the funds are needed in 2026, ideally “at the very beginning of the year”.\n",

      "Ryanair has scrapped a VIP loyalty scheme offering ticket discounts after members booked too many cheap flights.\n",
      "On Friday, the low-cost airline said it was ending its “Prime” membership programme after just eight months because a surge of bookings had led to €1.6m (£1.4m) of losses.\n",
      "Under the plan, members could pay £79 a year and get monthly discounts of up to £60 off return flights, as well as free travel insurance and seat reservations.\n",
      "However, Ryanair said the trial programme had “cost more money than it generated” with subscription fees bringing in €4.4m but members receiving more than €6m in discounts.\n",
      "The scheme will be closed to new members with immediate effect before shutting down completely next October.\n",
      "Dara Brady, Ryanair’s marketing chief, said that while 55,000 people had signed up, at least two million members would have been needed to make it a success.\n",
      "“Generally with these programmes, if someone takes the full value of everything it will end up costing you money no matter who you are,” he said.\n",
      "“We gave it a go. It was just about washing its face but there wasn’t much in it for us. We needed it to be much higher volume.\n",
      "“It took more effort than it was worth. You needed to manage monthly fares and the comms schedule and monitor the system to make sure people were getting their allocations. It was a lot of work for a very small proportion of our passengers.”\n",
      "Mr Brady said Ryanair could have worked to lift membership towards 200,000 to generate more fees – but this would still have been “small beans” at an airline carrying 200 million people a year and generating €13bn in revenue.\n",
      "The marketing chief said the initiative had been well intentioned and was created after passengers had pressed it for a membership scheme.\n",
      "However, he said the outcome of the experiment suggested loyalty schemes were better suited to the full-service, long-haul carriers such as British Airways.\n",
      "“There were some great bargains. But people who are travelling once or twice a year are not going to sign up and someone flying from Manchester back to Dublin every month already knows the drill,” he said.\n",
      "“They say, ‘Look, I get the low fares anyway and I’ll decide at the time whether I’m taking a reserved seat and insurance. I’m not deciding now for the next 12 months.’\n",
      "“Loyalty programmes work better on long-haul, premium routes, which we don’t do. In the low-cost market, what drives loyalty is price. If we drop fares we get the customers anyway.\n",

      "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/african-nation-built-development-diamonds-040543518.html\n",
      "SELLO MOTSETA and FARAI MUTSAKA\n",
      "Sat, November 29, 2025 at 11:05 AM GMT+7\n",
      "GABORONE, Botswana (AP) — In a village outside Botswana ’s capital, Keorapetse Koko sat on an aging couch in her sparsely furnished home, stunned that a career — and an entire nation’s economy — built on diamonds had fallen so far, so fast.\n",
      "For 17 years, she had earned a living cutting and polishing the gems that helped transform Botswana from one of the world’s poorest nations into one of Africa’s success stories. Diamonds were discovered in 1967, a year after independence, an abrupt change of fortune for the landlocked country.\n",
      "Botswana became the world’s top diamond producer by value, and second-largest by volume after Russia. Diamonds are woven into the national identity, with local Olympic champion runner Letsile Tebogo heading a De Beers campaign celebrating how the industry funds schools and stadiums.\n",
      "The stones that Koko and thousands of others dug and polished over the decades have funded Botswana’s health, education, infrastructure and more. The country risked the “resource curse” of building its economy on a single natural asset — and unlike many African nations, it was a success.\n",
      "But Koko lost her job a year ago, joining many others left adrift as Africa’s trade in natural diamonds buckles under growing pressure from cheaper lab-grown diamonds mass-produced mainly in China and India.\n",
      "“I have debts and I don’t know how I am going to pay them,” said the mother of two, who had survived on about $300 a month and relied on her employer for medical insurance. It had been a decent situation for a semi-skilled worker in a country where the average monthly salary is about $500. “Every month they call me asking for money. But where do I get it?”\n",
      "‘Diamonds built our country’\n",
      "Botswana, which has unearthed some of the world’s biggest stones, has prided itself on prudently managing its natural wealth, avoiding the corruption and fighting that have plagued many African peers. Its marketing message has been simple: Its stones are conflict-free and help fund development.\n",
      "“Diamonds built our country,” said Joseph Tsimako, president of the Botswana Mine Workers Union, which represents about 10,000 workers in the nation of 2.5 million people. “Now, as the world changes, we must find a way to make sure they don’t destroy the lives of the people who helped build it.”\n",
      "He warned that new U.S. tariffs under the Trump administration could worsen Botswana’s downturn, triggering staffing freezes, unpaid leave and more layoffs. The U.S. has imposed a 15% tariff on diamonds that are mined, cut and polished there.\n",
      "Diamond exports, roughly 80% of Botswana’s foreign earnings and a third of government revenue, have tumbled.\n",
      "Debswana, the largest local diamond producer and a joint venture between the government and mining giant De Beers, saw revenues halve last year. It has paused operations at some mines as Botswana and Angola enter talks to take over controlling stakes in De Beers’ diamond mining unit.\n",
      "In September, Botswana’s national statistics agency reported a 43% drop in diamond output in the second quarter, the steepest fall in the country’s modern mining history. The World Bank expects the economy to shrink 3% this year, the second consecutive contraction.\n",
      "The rise of synthetic diamonds\n",
      "The global rise of synthetic diamonds has been swift. They have “given stiff competition, especially in lower-quality stones,” said Siddarth Gothi, chairman of the Botswana Diamond Manufacturers Association.\n",
      "The gems emerged in the 1950s for industrial use. By the 1970s they had reached jewelry quality. Lab-grown stones now sell for up to 80% less than natural diamonds. Once making up just 1% of global sales in 2015, they have surged to nearly 20%.\n",
      "Glitzy social media videos have fueled the appeal of synthetic gems made in weeks under intense heat and pressure and marketed as cheaper, conflict-free and eco-friendly alternatives to stones formed over billions of years.\n",
      "Environmental groups have said natural diamond mining can drive deforestation, destroy habitats, degrade the soil and pollute the water. But environmental claims about the synthetic gems also face scrutiny, with critics noting that production remains energy-intensive, often powered by fossil fuels.\n",
      "From “a marginal phenomenon,” an “unprecedented flood” of synthetics now threatens the natural diamond’s value and future, World Federation of Diamond Bourses president Yoram Dvash warned in July.\n",
      "Lab-grown stones now account for most new U.S. engagement rings, he said. Natural diamond prices have fallen roughly 30% since 2022, leaving the industry at what Dvash called “a critical juncture.”\n",
      "Hollywood stars, including Billie Eilish and Pamela Anderson, and Bollywood celebrities have boosted synthetic diamonds’ allure, along with Gen Z influencers.\n",
      "“The new generation of youngsters getting engaged, they’ve got far more important things to spend their money on than a diamond,” said Ian Furman, founder of Naturally Diamonds, which sells natural and synthetic diamonds in neighboring South Africa. “So, it’s become so attractive to them to buy lab diamonds.\"\n",
      "Furman said that for every 100 diamonds his company sells, around 95 are synthetic when just five or six years ago it was overwhelmingly natural diamonds.\n",
      "African producers feel the pain\n",
      "The shift is felt beyond Botswana. Across southern Africa, falling production of natural diamonds and revenue have led to job cuts and financial strain.\n",
      "To counter the trend, Botswana, Angola, Namibia, South Africa and Congo in June agreed to pool 1% of annual diamond revenues, translating into millions of dollars, into a global marketing push led by the Natural Diamond Council to promote natural stones. The nonprofit’s members include major mining companies such as De Beers Group and Rio Tinto, which have invested heavily in natural diamonds.\n",
      "Last year, the council launched a “Real. Rare. Responsible” campaign starring actor Lily James in a bid to recast natural diamonds as unique and ethically sourced.\n",
      "Kristina Buckley Kayel, the council’s managing director for North America, said restoring natural diamonds’ “desirability” is essential to protect producer economies, particularly in southern Africa.\n",
      "With its diamond income no longer assured, Botswana’s government in September created a sovereign wealth fund focused on investment and diversification beyond mining, although details about its value and investors sketchy. Suddenly, the country’s elephant-heavy tourism industry and other mining options, including gold, silver and uranium, are more important than ever.\n",
      "But for Koko, the laid-off diamond worker, the policy shift may have come too late.\n",
      "“I was the breadwinner in a big family,” she said. “Now I don’t even know how to feed my own. Looking for another job is very difficult. The skills I learned are only relevant to the diamond industry.”\n",
      "She never owned a diamond herself. Even the smallest would be a luxury beyond her means.\n",

      "A couple earning six figures from 28 rental units explains how they use a 'buy box' to ensure positive cash flow\n",

      "Sat, November 29, 2025 at 10:41 AM GMT+7\n",
      "Ted and Jamie Garber own 28 rental units in Florida, focusing on cash flow and ROI.\n",
      "They started investing in 2020 to create an additional revenue stream.\n",
      "They're looking for undervalued properties in their market that satisfy the 1% rule.\n",
      "Ted and Jamie Garber, two real estate investors, have specific cash flow and ROI goals for each of their rental properties.\n",
      "\"Each rental needs to shed cash flow immediately and, on average, pay back our initial investment within three to six years,\" Ted told Business Insider, adding that they treat each unit as if it's its own miniature business.\n",
      "The Florida couple started buying rentals in 2020 to create an additional revenue stream and accelerate their progress toward financial independence. As of 2025, they own 28 units across 15 commercial and residential properties, which BI confirmed through the Brevard County Property Appraiser.\n",
      "Their average cash-on-cash return is just north of 20%, Ted said.\n",
      "To guarantee immediate cash flow, they've narrowed down their \"buy box\" — the set of criteria they've established that they want to see in a property before purchasing. Here's exactly what they're looking for.\n",
      "1. Properties in their backyard. The Garbers, who live on the east coast of Florida in Brevard County, like to keep their investment properties close to home — at least for now.\n",
      "\"We're still focused on our backyard. It's still appreciating. It's still in high demand,\" said Ted, who manages each of their 15 properties. While they'd eventually like to expand to different markets, there is enough opportunity on the Space Coast to keep them busy in the near future.\n",
      "2. Affordability. \"Our buy box is affordable housing — not low, not high — something that just the everyday person can rent,\" Ted said, adding that they prefer to rent at or below market rates. \"That allows us to get a lot of applications to really be able to pick and choose our tenants. And, our tenants value the fact that they're renting slightly below market rate, so they're going to want to take care of the place. They're getting a deal, and we're still making money from it all.\"\n",
      "3. Undervalued properties. One of the reasons the couple can offer at or below market rent is because they won't purchase unless they've secured an excellent deal. They subscribe to the principle that \"you make money on the buy,\" Ted said.\n",
      "To find undervalued properties or negotiable deals, \"we would look for things that had been sitting for a while — maybe the marketing wasn't very good or it needed a cosmetic renovation,\" Jamie said.\n",
      "Ted added that they're not looking for a major renovation project: \"Part of the buy box is looking for smaller lift, value-add things like paint and floors. We also look for listings that don't have the best pictures and aren't marketed correctly.\"\n",
      "The Garbers constantly look at listings in their area. When they come across something in their buy box, the next step is to see whether the property will satisfy the \"1% rule.\"\n",
      "This general rule of thumb suggests that to create positive cash flow, the monthly rent of your property should be at least 1% of the purchase price.\n",
      "\"So, if you're looking at a condo that is $120,000, you need to be able to rent it for $1,200 a month,\" Ted said, noting that it's become more difficult in the past couple of years to satisfy this rule with rising interest rates, insurance rates, and condo fees. They'd ideally have a buffer: For example, renting a $120,000 condo for $1,500 a month.\n",
      "They have the advantage of already owning several long-term rentals and understanding typical rental rates in their area, but you can use tools like Zillow to get a feel for rent in your market.\n",
      "While their main focus is on cash flow, they're reaping more benefits from owning real estate.\n",
      "\"There's appreciation — adding to your net worth and your end goal; depreciation, so the ability to offset your income and your taxes; and then another main benefit is that your tenants are paying off your mortgage for you,\" Ted said.\n",
      "\"If we factor in all those other things, we're at more than a 30% return on investment throughout the portfolio.\"\n",

      "Sat, November 29, 2025 at 9:59 AM GMT+7\n",
      "NEW YORK (AP) — Chain stores have Black Friday. Online marketplaces have Cyber Monday. For local businesses, it's Small Business Saturday.\n",
      "In the last 20 years, more segments of the retail industry have vied for their own piece of the holiday shopping season. The travel trade has firmly joined the trend with another post-Thanksgiving sales push: Travel Tuesday.\n",
      "On the same day as the nonprofit world's Giving Tuesday, airlines, hotels, cruise ship companies, travel booking platforms and tour operators get in on the annual spirit to spend by promoting one-day deals. Consumer advocates say there are legitimate savings to be had but also chances to be misled by marketing that conveys a false sense of urgency.\n",
      "\"People see ‘40 percent off’ and assume it’s a once-in-a-lifetime steal, without recognizing that the underlying price may have been inflated or that the same itinerary was cheaper last month.” Sally French, a travel expert at personal finance site NerdWallet, said.\n",
      "She and other seasoned travelers advised consumers who want to see if they can save money by booking trips on Travel Tuesday to do research in advance and to pay especially close pay to the fine print attached to offers.\n",
      "People hoping to score last-minute deals for Christmas or New Year's should double-check for blackout dates or other restrictions, recommended Lindsay Schwimer, a consumer expert for the online travel site Hopper.\n",
      "It’s also wise to to keep an eye out for nonrefundable fares, resort fees, double occupancy requirements or upgrade conditions that may be hidden within advertised discounts, according to French.\n",
      "Shoppers should be wary of travel packages with extra transportation options or add-on offers, French said. Instead of lowering fares or room rates, some companies use statement credits, extra points, included amenities and bundled extras as a way to tempt potential customers, she said.\n",
      "“Many travel brands want to keep sticker prices high to maintain an aura of luxury, but they still need to fill planes, ships and hotel rooms,” French said. “Add-on perks are their workaround.”\n",
      "Consumers who are prepared rather than impulsive and on the lookout for the up-sell are in a much better position to identify authentic bargains, consumer experts stressed. Knowing what a specific trip would typically cost and comparison shopping can help expose offers based on inflated underlying costs and whether the same itinerary might have been cheaper at other times, they said.\n",
      "“Compare prices, check your calendar and make sure the trip you’re booking is something you genuinely want, not something you bought because a countdown timer pressured you,\" French said. \"What gets glossed over is that the best deal might be not booking anything at all if it doesn’t align with your plans.”\n",
      "Travel Tuesday came about based on existing industry trends. In 2017, Hopper analyzed historical pricing data and found that in each of the nine previous years, the biggest day for post-Thanksgiving travel discounts was the day after Cyber Monday.\n",
      "The site named the day Travel Tuesday. The number of offers within that time-targeted window and the number of travelers looking for them has since expanded.\n",
      "“Nearly three times as many trips were planned on Travel Tuesday last year compared to Black Friday,” Hopper's Schwimer said. “We continue to see growth in the day, year over year, as more travel brands and categories offer deals.”\n",
      "The event's origin story is in with the National Retail Federation coined Cyber Monday in 2005 as a response to the emerging e-commerce era. American Express came up with Small Business Saturday in 2010 to direct buyers and their dollars to smaller retailers, credit card fees and all.\n",
      "A report by the consulting firm McKinsey & Company last year noted that November and December tend to be slow months for travel bookings, making Travel Tuesday a “marketing moment” that could help boost revenue.\n",
      "Hotel, cruise and and airline bookings by U.S. travelers increased significantly on Travel Tuesday 2023 compared with the two weeks before and after the day, the report's authors wrote, citing data provided by the travel marketing platform Sojern.\n",
      "While Travel Tuesday so far has been mostly confined to the United States and Canada, “European travel companies can anticipate the possibility that Travel Tuesday will become a growing phenomenon in their region, given that other shopping days such as Black Friday and Cyber Monday have spread beyond North America,” the report stated.\n",
      "Vivek Pandya, lead insights analyst for Adobe Analytics, which tracks online spending, said consumers have more tools than ever this holiday season to help them determine if deals hold up to scrutiny.\n",
      "“Social journeys, influencers providing promo codes and values, and generative AI platforms taking all that in - the prices, the social conversation, the reviews - and giving guidance to the consumer, that's a very different, dynamic kind of journey consumers are taking than they have in previous seasons,” Pandya said.\n",
      "Both he and French emphasized that prices rise and fall based on multiple factors, and that the winter holidays are not the only major promotional period of the year.\n",
      "“We now have dozens of consumer spending ‘holidays,’” French said. “Amazon alone keeps adding new versions of Prime Day. So if you don’t buy on Travel Tuesday, you haven’t missed your moment.”\n",

      "This month, Burry pivoted from running a hedge fund to publishing a Substack named \"Cassandra Unchained.\" It has amassed more than 97,000 subscribers since it launched on Sunday.\n",
      "\"This is a conversation space exclusively for paid subscribers—kind of like a group chat or live hangout,\" reads Burry's introductory post. \"I plan to post updates that come my way, and you can jump into the discussion.\"\n",
      "The first reply on the chat reads: \"I think Dr. Burry just broke Substack.\"\n",
      "Another early response jokes about Burry's disclosure this week that he owns bearish put options on Nvidia and Palantir stock: \"I think Dr Burry is going to make more money from Substack than his NVDA and pltr puts 🤣\"\n",
      "A third poked fun at a potential spike in traffic to Substack. \"Someone pray for substacks backend engineers.\"\n",
      "\"It's gonna be legendburry!!\" one subscriber wrote, while another noted: \"This chat is gonna be nuts.\"\n",
      "\"Bro don't allow anyone to start threads. This a spam fest,\" one concerned poster added.\n",
      "Other subscribers rushed to post memes, videos, and even photos of Black Friday crowds. The questions to Burry ranged from who the next chair of the Federal Reserve might be, to how an 80-year-old should invest to prepare for a crash, to how the dollar stacks up against other currencies.\n",
      "Burry resurfaced on X in late October after more than two years of silence, and has wasted no time issuing numerous warnings of an AI bubble and taking aim at key players such as Nvidia and Palantir.\n",

      "American shoppers are delivering a record-breaking Black Friday, with online spending already reaching $8.6 billion by early evening and projections suggesting the final tally could exceed initial forecasts, according to data from Adobe Analytics.\n",
      "Black Friday online spending through 6:30 p.m. ET represents 9.4% growth compared to last year, slightly outpacing Adobe's earlier forecast of 8.3% growth for the day.\n",
      "Adobe now expects consumers will spend between $11.7 billion and $11.9 billion by the time Black Friday concludes, up from its earlier projection of $11.7 billion. This would set a new single-day record for online shopping. Adobe also found that more buyers are turning to AI tools and Buy Now Pay Later options to make purchases.\n",
      "The data comes from analyzing commerce transactions across over 1 trillion visits to US retail sites, covering 100 million products across 18 categories.\n",
      "\"Adobe surveyed over 1,000 US consumers and nearly half believe the best deals this season will come on Black Friday, pushing many to hit buy on products before Cyber Monday,\" said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, in a statement. \"Given the strong spending so far today, we anticipate the final tally for online shopping on Black Friday will exceed our initial forecast.\"\n",
      "The strong Black Friday performance sets the stage for what Adobe expects to be a robust Cyber Week, the five-day period spanning Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday. The company forecasts that period will account for 17.2% of the entire holiday season's spending, totaling $43.7 billion, up 6.3% from last year.\n",
      "The hottest sellers so far include televisions, the newly released Nintendo Switch 2, Apple AirPods 4, and the Oura Ring 4. Kitchen items, such as KitchenAid stand mixers and storage containers, have also been flying off virtual shelves, along with washers and dryers, bicycles, and basketball hoops.\n",
      "Adobe's survey found that 50% of respondents planned to shop for apparel and accessories online on Black Friday, followed by toys at 40% and computers and electronics at 36%.\n",
      "The surge in spending has been fueled by discounts that ran deeper than analysts initially anticipated. Electronics saw the steepest markdowns at up to 29% off list prices, followed by toys at 28%, apparel at 25%, and televisions at 24%. Computers, appliances, furniture, and sporting goods all saw significant price cuts ranging from 19% to 23% off.\n",
      "Shoppers are increasingly turning to artificial intelligence for help navigating deals and finding the right products. AI-driven traffic to retail sites, measured by shoppers clicking on links from AI assistants, is expected to surge 600% compared to last year.\n",
      "In Adobe's survey, nearly half of respondents said they have used or plan to use AI for online shopping this season, primarily for finding deals, conducting product research, and getting recommendations.\n",
      "The growing reliance on AI shopping tools comes as companies race to integrate the technology into the holiday shopping experience. Earlier this week, OpenAI introduced a shopping research feature in ChatGPT that builds personalized buyer's guides by asking clarifying questions and surfacing information from across the web.\n",
      "Mobile shopping continued its dominance, accounting for 58.6% of online sales so far and driving $5.1 billion in spending, a 11.3% year-over-year increase. That represents a higher mobile share than last year's Black Friday, when phones and tablets accounted for 55% of purchases.\n",
      "Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) services also experienced heightened activity, with the payment option expected to drive $761.8 million in Black Friday spending, representing an 11% increase from the previous year.\n",
      "The vast majority of these installment purchases happen on mobile devices, which account for 82.4% of BNPL transactions this holiday season. Consumers are most likely to use the payment option for electronics, apparel, toys, and furniture.\n",

      "Buying a dividend stock and forgetting about it isn’t as simple as it sounds, even for seasoned income investors. The market could crash, the income potential might not be worth it, and you might end up thinking that your money is better off somewhere else.\n",
      "That said, the buy-and-forget approach isn’t impossible either. Buy-and-Forget stocks are investors' “core holdings” that they keep forever, regardless of what happens. And today, I came up with three such dividend stocks from the Dividend Kings list that anyone can hold for as long as they like. Dividend Kings are companies that not only have solid track records of paying dividends, but they have also increased them for over 50+ years.\n",

      "Right now, AbbVie’s stock is trades around $227 and has gained about 112% over the past 5 years. Its 60-month beta is 0.50, so it’s relatively stable.\n",
      "AbbVie pays a forward dividend of $6.56, distributed $1.64 per share per quarter. This payout translates to a 2.9% forward yield. The dividend payout ratio is 68.08% of the company’s earnings, which is in a very acceptable range.\n",
      "Financials-wise, AbbVie’s recent annual revenue rose 3.7% to $56.33 billion. However, net income declined 12% to $4.27 billion, or $2.40 basic EPS, mainly driven by a significant increase in R&D expenses.\n",
      "Meanwhile, a consensus of 28 analysts rates AbbVie a Moderate Buy with a score of 4.14 out of 5. That is pretty close to a Strong Buy rating. This score has been relatively stable over the last 3 months. The high price target for the stock is $289, suggesting as much as 27% upside from current levels.\n",
      "The next Dividend King needs little to no introduction: the Coca-Cola company. Almost every person on the planet comes across a Coca-Cola product, at least once a day. They own a wide array of beverage drinks beyond the iconic Coca-Cola.\n",
      "Today, the stock trades around $72, and has gained >35% over the past 5 years. Not explosive, but the upward trajectory is clear. The 60-month beta is 0.43, which proves the stability of this stock relative to the broader market.\n",
      "Coca-Cola pays a forward dividend of $2.04, paid $0.51 every quarter, reflecting a forward yield of 2.86%. The company’s payout ratio is 67.64%, which is also very acceptable to income-growth investors.\n",
      "Last year, Coca-Cola’s annual revenue rose 2.8% to around $47 billion, while net income decreased less than 1% to $10.63 billion, or $2.47 per share, as operating expenses rose slightly.\n",
      "Based on consensus among 24 analysts, Coca-Cola stock has an average Strong Buy rating with a near-perfect score of 4.75 out of 5. The score was relatively stable over the last 3 months - or perhaps, even years. The high target for Coca-Cola is $85 per share, which translates to an upside of 17% from current levels.\n",
      "Finally, the last Dividend King on my list is Johnson & Johnson, a healthcare giant that operates in several segments, including pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and consumer health products. Johnson & Johnson also develops treatments for complicated health conditions.\n",
      "Today, JNJ stock trades at about $207 per share and has gained ~38% over the past 5 years. Not overly explosive, but the stock is certainly stable, with a 60-month beta of just 0.38.\n",
      "Payout-wise, Johnson & Johnson pays a quarterly dividend of $1.30, which translates to a forward annual dividend $5.20 per share, translating to a yield of about 2.6%. The payout ratio is also within a very acceptable range of 48.63%.\n",
      "The company’s most recent annual revenue increased 4.3% to $88.82 billion. Meanwhile, net income declined 60% to $14 billion, or $5.84 per basic share. However, investors need to remember that 2023's net income is inflated, as J&J recorded a one-time gain of roughly $21 billion from spinning off Kenvue, its Consumer Health segment. As a result, 2026's number should be normalized against this FY.\n",
      "Meanwhile, a consensus among 25 analysts points to a Moderate Buy rating with a score of 4.12 out of 5, and this has been gradually increasing in recent months. The high price target for JNJ is $230 per share, implying roughly 11% upside potential from where we are now.\n",
      "Mega-cap Dividend Kings are some of the safest options for a buy-and-forget strategy. For the companies mentioned above, the chance of them reaching zero is also almost zero. However, the market can do funny things. The smart money keeps on top of the news, watches the financials, and reinvests those dividends for explosive compound growth- especially if there are years before the income is ever needed.\n",

      "Michael Burry has warned AI giants are overstating how long their Nvidia chips will stay relevant.\n",
      "Bridgewater's Greg Jensen said the chips may be used to invent better chips that make them obsolete.\n",
      "While Burry has warned about circular deals in AI, Jensen said Nvidia is building an ecosystem.\n",
      "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame has said some of the world's largest AI companies are exaggerating how long their Nvidia chips will last to pad their short-term profits. Now, one hedge fund boss has warned that those chips could make themselves obsolete.\n",
      "Greg Jensen, the co-chief investor of Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates, told the \"In Good Company\" podcast this week that the \"depreciation schedule is probably going to be quite fast, and you hope it has to be in a sense.\"\n",
      "Jensen explained there's a \"resource grab\" in AI as companies compete for scarce land, energy, microchips, and scientists, and tech bosses are hoping AI itself can help.\n",
      "\"One of the things they have to do is figure out how to make the chips more efficient, make the energy more efficient, and they're trying to use AI to do those things,\" he said.\n",
      "Jensen predicted that some of the scientific advances that will \"depreciate the current assets will come from those assets themselves,\" as \"AI will generate better ways to do this.\"\n",
      "Burry shot to fame after his massive bet against the US housing bubble was immortalized in the book \"The Big Short,\" and a movie adaptation starring actor Christian Bale as Burry.\n",
      "He resurfaced on X in late October after more than two years of silence. Since then, he has sounded the alarm on an AI bubble, closed his hedge fund to outside cash, launched a Substack to share his research, and disclosed he owns bearish put options on Nvidia and another AI darling, Palantir.\n",
      "Burry has taken aim at the AI giants for dragging out depreciation from around three years to six years or longer, pointing out that Nvidia is releasing new chips faster and faster, so the current generation will likely lose value more quickly.\n",
      "\"The hyperscalers have been systematically increasing the useful lives of chips and servers, for depreciation purposes, as they invest hundreds of billions of dollars in graphics chips with accelerating planned obsolescence,\" he wrote on Substack this week.\n",
      "The investor has also called out the sprawling web of \"give-and-take deals\" between AI companies.\n",
      "Jensen said those aren't a product of \"normal bubble dynamics\" — companies juicing their financials to justify their lofty valuations — as \"Nvidia can get as much revenue as it wants\" given the immense demand for its chips.\n",
      "Instead, Jensen said, Nvidia is scrambling to create its own ecosystem of buyers who won't develop their own chips, in an attempt to stop Alphabet from owning the entire AI \"stack.\"\n",
      "\"They're like Standard Oil in the Gilded Age, trying to create monopolistic control on things,\" Jensen said about Nvidia. He added that \"everybody's got to lock up who do I partner with, where am I going to get my chips and power — and if I don't do it, I'm going to die.\"\n",
      "Jensen also said the AI investment boom isn't a typical capital cycle, as bosses such as Elon Musk and Sam Altman believe they're in a race to develop a supreme intelligence, and are willing to spend whatever it takes to win.\n",

      "NBC News \n",
      "No tickers found\n",
      "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/working-tariffs-small-christmas-supply-233109769.html\n",
      "Maya Huter\n",
      "Sat, November 29, 2025 at 6:31 AM GMT+7\n",
      "This holiday season, tariffs are threatening the survival of a small Christmas supply business outside of Salt Lake City.\n",
      "Jared and Dawnita Hendricks have owned Village Lighting for 23 years, selling and distributing a variety of Christmas products to big box stores and directly to consumers online. The company currently employs 15 people.\n",
      "But when Village Lighting's 2025 holiday season garlands, wreaths, lights and decor arrived by ship at U.S. ports from Asia in recent months, many of them carried additional tariff costs of up to 50% per item.\n",
      "These added fees are the result of President Donald Trump's far-reaching tariff agenda, which has raised U.S. import duties to levels not seen in over a century.\n",
      "The Trump administration claims tariffs will boost the U.S. economy in part by forcing manufacturers to move operations to the United States, and further by forcing U.S. trade partners to make concessions.\n",
      "But these global economic forces feel very far away from West Valley City, Utah, where tariff costs at Village Lighting are outpacing the company's expected profit margins.\n",
      "“The tariff costs in and of themselves are not sustainable, and I don’t believe we can raise the cost enough to the consumers to be profitable,” Jared Hendricks told NBC News during an interview at his warehouse in Utah.\n",
      "It’s an issue plaguing the entire Christmas decor industry, which for decades has relied on goods imported from Asia.\n",
      "American small businesses importing holiday decor this year have already spent more than $400 million on tariff fees, according to an estimate from a coalition of small businesses called “We Pay the Tariffs,” which counts Village Lighting among its members.\n",
      "Compared to the roughly $26 million these same companies paid in tariffs last year, that's an increase of at least 1,438%.\n",
      "Across the United States, companies of all sizes have tried to time their overseas orders in the hopes of avoiding the worst tariff fees.\n",
      "But for Village Lighting, which orders inventory up to a year in advance, this wasn't an option.\n",
      "After enjoying one of the company's most successful years ever in 2024, the Hendrickses decided to order extra inventory this year, a process that began last December and was completed by February.\n",
      "So when Trump announced sweeping tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners in early April, it was too late for the Hendrickses to cut back their orders, which were already loaded on container ships by the time the tariffs took effect.\n",
      "In an effort to keep their prices as low as possible, the Hendrickses have opted to absorb the majority of the added tariff costs.\n",
      "So far, that has cost them nearly $750,000 and counting. Tariffs are withdrawn directly from the couple’s bank account 30 days after each product arrives at a U.S. port.\n",
      "Their goal is to keep any retail price hikes under 5% this Christmas season.\n",
      "But the only way to do that, said Jared, was by “leveraging everything,” including their home, with a line of credit.\n",
      "“We went from working towards a profit to working for tariffs,” said Jared. “It’s affected our home life, our health. It has been the most stressful, difficult, challenging year of 23 years of businesses that we ever had.”\n",
      "This isn't the first time Village Lighting has had to contend with abrupt changes to tariff rates.\n",
      "During the first Trump administration, average U.S. tariff rates on Chinese imports swelled to around 20%, up from a simple tariff rate of just 2.8% in 2015.\n",
      "The Hendrickses responded at the time by attempting to diversify their supply chain across several Southeast Asian countries, including Indonesia, Cambodia and Malaysia.\n",
      "But these countries were all hit with high tariffs in early April of this year, swept up in Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs.\n",
      "At that point, said Jared, all his planning “went out the window.”\n",
      "Moving Village Lighting’s manufacturing operations to the United States would be nearly impossible, the Hendrickses say, because of the type of complex machinery and skilled labor that are required to make the Christmas goods they sell.\n",
      "“A dozen different factories go into one wreath or garland,” Jared said. “It’s not a matter of me opening up one factory. It’s a matter of me opening up two dozen factories and somehow providing a pathway to get raw materials.”\n",
      "He said that it was unlikely “that anyone in our situation could ever financially find a way to make that happen.”\n",
      "The Hendrickses are not alone in feeling the sting of tariffs this holiday season. Consumers are dealing with it, too.\n",
      "According to a recent survey from the National Retail Federation, 85% of shoppers expect to pay more this year because of tariffs.\n",
      "And they’re right — Lending Tree, an online lending marketplace, found that tariffs will cost the average American an additional $132 on their holiday expenses this year. Goldman Sachs estimates that consumers are picking up as much as 55% of overall tariff costs.\n",
      "The Hendrickses said they feel like small businesses are bearing the brunt of Trump’s tariff pains.\n",
      "“When there was Covid, it felt like the whole country was kind of in it together,” said Dawnita Hendricks. “This kind of feels like it’s just us against the failure of our business, because of something we cannot control.”\n",
      "That lack of control is clouding Village Lighting’s future.\n",
      "“After 23 years, you kind of start thinking about, What’s the second half of my life going to look like?” said Jared.\n",
      "“Are we going to be able to move to the next level so that we can retire and enjoy our grandchildren and whatever?”\n",
      "Tariffs, he said, “really just put a halt to that and made us question, ‘What’s next?’”\n",

      "Stocks across the board gained in Friday’s shortened session despite a CME Group outage that disrupted futures trading overnight.\n",
      "The Nasdaq-led gains were bolstered by chip stocks including Intel, Analog Devices and Micron Technology, and Magnificent Seven names like Amazon and Meta Platforms. Nvidia defied the trend, dropping 1.8% and capping a rocky month for the stock.\n",
      "This week’s upturn, which pushed the S&P 500 and Dow into the black for November, helped notch a seventh consecutive month of gains. That marks the blue-chip index’s longest winning streak since the start of 2018.\n",
      "CME said its derivatives markets reopened at 8:30 a.m. ET on Friday. Before then, traders hadn’t been able to buy or sell CME futures and options, including for U.S. indexes, Treasurys, gold and oil, due to cooling problems at a key data center. Analysts said the CME outage lowered trading volumes on what was already expected to be one of the year’s quietest trading days.\n",
      "Some investors are cautiously optimistic about the market’s next move, viewing the recent tech-driven decline as a welcome correction that has brought down the valuations of the more speculative market areas.\n",

      "Global markets were little changed, with the Stoxx Europe 600 and Japan’s Nikkei 225 rising less than 0.3%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell by a similar percentage. The European benchmark notched a fifth consecutive monthly gain, while the two Asian gauges ended November in the red.\n",
      "Shares of some U.S. retail chains rose, as shoppers flocked to snap up Black Friday bargains. Walmart gained 1.3%. The National Retail Federation forecasts a record 186.9 million people to shop between Thanksgiving and “Cyber Monday” on Dec. 1.\n",
      "Expectations for a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut next month, following signs the labor market is cooling, have bolstered markets. Fed allies of Chair Jerome Powell have laid the groundwork for him to push a cut through a divided committee. Traders have doubled their bets over the last week on a reduction to around 87%, according to the CME’s FedWatch tool.\n",
      "“Would a 0.25-percentage-point reduction in the federal-funds rate make a significant difference? Not by itself, but it carries important signaling value,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economic strategist at Annex Wealth Management. “A cut could indicate not only that the Fed recognizes signs of a softening labor market, but—more importantly—that it is prepared to act in response.”\n",
      "Silver front-month futures jumped Friday, topping $56 per troy ounce and hitting a record high. Analysts attributed the surge to a supply squeeze, with Chinese inventories at the lowest level in a decade, as well as expectations for another Fed cut. Prices for silver, which holds value as both a precious and an industrial metal, have almost doubled this year. Gold futures also rallied Friday, settling at their highest level in over a month.\n",
      "The dollar held broadly steady against a basket of other currencies, after slipping earlier this week. Treasury yields edged up but remained around their lowest levels since late October.\n",
      "Bitcoin topped $92,000 before paring some gains. It has regained ground after sliding below $81,000 last week but remains far off its October peak above $126,000. Shares in Coinbase and bitcoin-buyer Strategy gained.\n",

      "Tether had planned to invest up to $500 million in Uruguay, including the construction of three data centers and a 300 megawatt renewable energy park. The stablecoin giant first started investing in sustainble bitcoin mining in the country back in 2023.\n",
      "According to its own account, more than $100 million has already been spent, with an additional $50 million committed to infrastructure that would have been handed over to the national grid operator, UTE.\n",
      "The company blamed high energy prices and regulatory hurdles for the pullout. Since 2023, it had requested a shift to a more competitive electricity rate structure, proposing to move from 31.5 kV to 150 kV transmission charges, according to local media.\n",
      "Tether argued that the change would benefit both parties by cutting costs and avoiding redundant infrastructure projects.\n",

      "Eric Kulisch\n",
      "Sat, November 29, 2025 at 4:20 AM GMT+7\n",
      "FedEx Corp. has canceled the December flight schedule for its fleet of MD-11 cargo jets, FreightWaves has learned, further signaling that federally-mandated inspections following the fiery crash of one of the planes early this month will take significantly longer than originally anticipated.\n",
      "The development dovetails with recent internal communications from UPS and Western Global Airlines, the other operators of the tri-engine MD-11, that their fleets are likely to be grounded for several months and be unavailable for the peak shipping season now underway.\n",
      "FedEx (NYSE: FDX) has scrubbed all MD-11 flights from the December schedule, according to an official with the union representing the company’s pilots and another person who is an MD-11 pilot. The decision makes clear the company doesn’t expect the plane to be available during the month and raises questions about whether the airline will again be without 8% of its main line capacity in January.\n",
      "“I don’t think this is going to be as short-term as people expected,” the FedEx MD-11 pilot, who asked for anonymity to prevent any employer repercussions, said in an interview.\n",
      "Following the deadly crash of UPS Flight 2976 in Louisville, Kentucky, the Federal Aviation Administration banned MD-11s from flying until the entire fleet is thoroughly inspected and any necessary repairs are completed. The National Transportation Safety Board on Nov. 20 said it found fatigue cracks in a structural section that held an engine to the left-wing.\n",
      "FedEx operated 28 MD-11s at the start of November.\n",
      "The level of regulators’ concern about the safety of the MD-11s is reflected by the fact that the FAA isn’t even issuing ferry permits for the aircraft so they can be flown from their current airfields to other locations for inspection or maintenance, according to the pilot source.\n",
      "FedEx pilots will get paid as normal for their December assignments, but exactly what the pay structure will be in the event of a January flight cancellation remains to be determined. There are about 500 MD-11 pilots at FedEx.\n",
      "The other source said the union has seen internal company emails indicating management intends to place MD-11 pilots on reserve duty in January, despite there being no defined flying or duty requirements at this time.\n",
      "“The association does not agree with applying reserve status and its related pay provisions in a circumstance where there is no operational need to be on reserve. We believe the situation would be best addressed through direct engagement between the company and the association to reach a solution that is appropriate and fair to both parties,” the union representative said.\n",
      "The FedEx Master Executive Council, part of the Air Line Pilots Association, is the bargaining unit for the express carrier’s pilots.\n",
      "“Safety is our highest priority at FedEx. We are working with Boeing and the FAA to address any required inspection and maintenance that may be needed to return our MD-11 aircraft safely to service,” spokeswoman Isabel Rollison said in a statement. “The flight schedules for December and January account for the MD-11s being currently grounded.”\n",
      "Meanwhile, UPS pilots have been informed that the inspection process, and possible repairs, for the MD-11s will likely take several months instead of a few weeks, as originally estimated, Brian Gaudet, a spokesman for the Independent Pilots Association, said Thursday evening.\n",
      "UPS (NYSE: UPS) employs 277 MD-11 pilots, according to IPA figures.\n",
      "The UPS pilots are pay protected, which means they will be compensated for flights they were already awarded in December and for future cycles, even if the fleet remains grounded, Gaudet explained in a phone call.\n",
      "The Louisville Courier-Journal, followed by other outlets, reported Thursday that UPS Airlines President Bill Moore conveyed in an internal letter that the MD-11 fleet will require more extensive inspections and potential repairs than first thought and the planes will remain grounded for several months.\n",
      "In his letter, Moore said Boeing’s ongoing evaluation of the aircraft model has led to the determination that removing engines and pylons may be necessary for “detailed inspections and repairs,” the Louisville paper said.\n",
      "Western Global Airlines has furloughed about 75 pilots who fly the MD-11 after learning from Boeing that the inspection process could drag out beyond this year.\n",
      "FedEx Chief Financial Officer, speaking at an investor conference on Nov. 11, said the inspection process was expected to be relatively quick and that the airline would return MD-11 freighters to service on a rolling basis after they passed safety checks and any required repairs. His comments came before the NTSB issued its preliminary accident report, in which it highlighted discovery of the fatigue cracks.\n",
      "The extended grounding of the MD-11 fleets could prove costly for the companies. FedEx and UPS, for example, have contracted with partner airlines to fill in a portion of the MD-11 flight schedules in their respective air networks.\n",

      "Nicholas Gordon\n",
      "Sat, November 29, 2025 at 4:00 AM GMT+7\n",
      "Nintendo is home to some of the most beloved characters in the video game industry—Mario, Pikachu, Kirby, and many others. But inside the company itself is another cast of beloved characters—the army of developers that has stuck with Nintendo for most of their careers.\n",
      "“It’s almost impossible for any developer who is now of working age to have grown up without at least some influence from Nintendo,” says Keza MacDonald, author of the forthcoming book Super Nintendo: The Game-Changing Company That Unlocked the Power of Play, based off years of reporting on the company as a games journalist. “It is still, to this day, making games differently from everyone else.”\n",
      "Indeed Nintendo has largely sidestepped the graphics arms race that has bedeviled both its hardware and software competitors, instead focusing on what Game Boy designer Gunpei Yokoi affectionately termed “withered technology”: Using well-established technology and focusing on making something fun instead. That strategy has also allowed Nintendo to avoid the high costs and constant retraining that are hamstringing its  competitors.\n",
      "The Japanese game developer embraced “the principle of finding a playful way to design things that aren’t necessarily at the cutting-edge,” explains MacDonald, who currently writes about gaming for The Guardian. “That’s been a part of Nintendo’s philosophy since before it was even making video games.”\n",
      "The Japanese company has what MacDonald deems a “slightly conservative” approach, ensuring that it maintains healthy profit margins and builds up large reserves of cash. “Nintendo always operates with an understanding that its next product might not be a hit,” she says.\n",
      "Nintendo released the Switch 2, its latest video game console, earlier this year. While a few commentators griped that Nintendo’s latest version was just more powerful (and more expensive) than the last, gamers seem to have flocked to the new device. The company now expects to sell 19 million Switch 2 units by March 2026, the end of its fiscal year. The company reported 1.1 trillion Japanese yen ($7 billion) in revenue between March and September, more than double what it generated the same period a year ago. It also earned 199 billion yen ($1.3 billion) in profit, an 83% jump. Shares are up 46% for 2025 so far.\n",
      "Nintendo was founded in 1889 as a company making playing cards and eventually moved to making toys in the 1960s. It shifted to video games in the 1970s, and had its first hit with Donkey Kong, developed by Shigeru Miyamoto, who eventually designed beloved franchises like Super Mario and The Legend of Zelda.\n",
      "The game industry is known for its churn: Studios expand and contract according to changing demand. Around 10% of developers reported being laid off last year, and over 40% said they felt the effects of layoffs, according to a survey from the Game Developers Conference. “What that does is it robs companies of not just the knowledge, but also the security that helps people do their best work,” MacDonald says.\n",
      "Nintendo, on the other hand, has sidestepped this boom and bust cycle. The company revealed earlier this year that its Japan-based employees had an average tenure of 15 years.\n",
      "“The people who first made Nintendo’s hits are still working at the company,” MacDonald says. “For the last 50 years, these people have been passing down knowledge and training up a new generation of Nintendo creatives.”\n",
      "She adds that the company also rejects hierarchy when it comes to design. “It’s not like the oldest guy gets to decide what’s a good idea and what isn’t. Everyone puts ideas in.”\n",
      "Not all of Nintendo’s experiments work. Take the company’s Wii U console, released in 2012. Unlike its predecessor, the wildly successful Wii, the Wii U was a flop, selling barely 14 million units. Yet Nintendo took some of the design lessons from this failure and put them towards the Nintendo Switch—which, at 154 million units sold, is close to being the top-selling console of all time.\n",
      "That’s just one of the things that MacDonald thinks that other companies—and not just those in the gaming industry—can learn from Nintendo.\n",
      "“A failed idea is often a step towards the next hit you’re going to have.”\n",

      "A Brazilian fintech firm, Tanssi, is rolling out a government-backed blockchain project that involves microloans for farmers in São Paulo, following the pilot of a local currency in the town of Santo Antônio da Alegria.\n",
      "During an interview with CoinDesk at the Blockchain Conference Brasil in São Paulo, Tanssi’s Director of Business Development, Luis Dal Porto, revealed that the microlending service is set to be launched next month, with a mobile application for its use already being live.\n",
      "The project is backed by São Paulo’s city government and offers up to R$15,000 ($2,800) in fast loans to small-scale rural producers. The system runs on a blockchain infrastructure built with Tanssi, which lets developers create dedicated blockchains, or “appchains.”\n",
      "While blockchain technology is used in the service, it’s done so only on the backend.\n",
      "\"In practice, the blockchain isn't even seen. It is a mobile app that they offer to producers. They also have physical payment machines,” Dal Porto told CoinDesk. “It is an entirely closed ecosystem they offer to achieve more control of how the credit is used and to mitigate risk.”\n",
      "The fintech behind the project chose Tanssi over public blockchains like Ethereum or Solana due to concerns over performance and cost, Dal Porto added. With public funds involved, the team prioritized predictable transaction fees and reliability, two things that are harder to guarantee on public, permissionless networks, which have in the past experienced issues with congestion, volatile transaction fees and, in some cases, downtime.\n",
      "\"A classic problem with any public blockchain is that there are moments of bottlenecks, moments of more expensive transactions. This takes away something that is very important to them: predictability,” Dal Porto explained. “They need to have the predictability that they will spend that specific capital, and it won’t be more than that. If they charge 5% and, for example, if the fee goes up or down, it is a cost they cannot predict.\"\n",
      "Although Brazil’s central bank has paused full deployment of its Drex digital currency, the project’s backers expect municipal and private blockchain initiatives to continue growing in parallel.\n",
      "The Santo Antônio project was announced last year and uses a token system to distribute municipal aid, such as food benefits, through a closed ecosystem that restricts how and where the funds can be spent. The tokens, accessed via a mobile app or physical payment terminals, are programmed to block purchases unrelated to the aid’s intent, like gambling on sports betting apps.\n",
      "The São Paulo microloan program is expected to go live next month.\n",

      "\"The market needs to prove it can sustain this momentum, but right now, the weakness after Nvidia's earnings looks like it could be more of a short-term AI-selling climax than a sign of heightened bearishness,\" Chris Larkin, Managing Director of trading and investing at E*TRADE from Morgan Stanley, said in an email.\n",
      "Some investors have expressed worry that an AI bubble could burst, triggering devastating financial losses. Bubbles occur when stocks surge on inflated growth expectations that ultimately prove to be disconnected from a company's underlying fundamentals.\n",
      "Some tech stocks did notch monthly gains, most notably Alphabet, which rose nearly 14%, due to excitement about its recently released Gemini AI model.\n",
      "The market turned around on hopes that the Federal Reserve would again cut interest rates at its meeting next month. Recent comments from Fed officials have given traders more confidence that the central bank will again cut interest rates at its meeting that ends Dec. 10.\n",
      "Traders are betting on a nearly 87% probability that the Fed will cut next month, according to data from CME Group.\n",
      "The central bank, which has already cut rates twice this year in hopes of shoring up the slowing job market, is facing an increasingly difficult decision on interest rates as inflation rises and the job market slows. Cutting interest rates further could help support the economy as employment weakens, but it could also fuel inflation. The latest round of corporate earnings reports was mostly positive, but economic data has been mixed.\n",
      "The minutes of the Fed's most recent meeting in October indicate there are likely to be strong divisions among policymakers about the Fed's next step.\n",
      "Investors also had their eye on retail stocks as they wait to see if shoppers rushed to take advantage of the annual Black Friday sales event. Macy's fell 0.3% while Kohl's gained 1.4%. Dick's Sporting Goods dropped 0.5%. Among specialty retailers, Abercrombie & Fitch rose 2.9% and American Eagle Outfitters gained 0.7%.\n",
      "Amid the volatility in tech stocks, traders moved money into other parts of the market. Pharmaceutical companies Eli Lilly and Merck each rose more than 20% for the month. Travel-related companies such as Marriott and Expedia also posted strong monthly gains.\n",
      "Earlier, futures for the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500 and Nasdaq were halted for hours due to a technical issue at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. CME said the problem was tied to an outage at a CyrusOne data center.\n",
      "Treasury yields rose slightly, with the 10-year yield at 4.02%.\n",

      "(Bloomberg) -- Metals surged in volatile trading on Friday, with silver and copper hitting fresh records, after a chaotic hours-long outage on CME Group’s Chicago Mercantile Exchange.\n",
      "Silver jumped as much as 5.9% to $56.53 an ounce, surpassing a peak set during a historic squeeze in the London market in October. The white metal has been supported by rising hopes of a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut in December, inflows into bullion-backed exchange-traded funds and ongoing supply tightness. Copper surged against the backdrop of supply shortfalls and bullish price predictions.\n",

      "The record-setting moves came amid low Black Friday trading volumes in the US following the CME disruptions. Spreads between what dealers and sellers would buy and sell gold for briefly surged earlier, signaling an illiquid market. As most trading operations resumed early in the US morning, futures on the London Metal Exchange extended their rally.\n",
      "Spot silver traded at $ an ounce as of  in New York. Gold rose  while platinum traded  higher. LME copper futures settled 2.3% higher in London after earlier hitting a fresh record of $11,210.50 a ton.\n",
      "Silver’s new high comes just over a month after a severe supply squeeze in the dominant trading hub in London last month, which sent prices soaring above levels in Shanghai and New York. While the arrival of nearly 54 million troy ounces has eased that squeeze, the market still remains markedly tight with the cost of borrowing the metal over one month hovering above its normal level.\n",
      "The flows into the London market have now put pressure on other hubs, including in China. Silver inventories in warehouses linked to the Shanghai Futures Exchange recently hit their lowest level since 2015, according to bourse data.\n",
      "“In the short term, a further price increase cannot be ruled out if registered silver inventories in China continue to decline,” analysts at Commerzbank AG wrote in a note earlier Friday.\n",
      "Traders are also monitoring any potential tariff on silver after the precious metal was added to the US Geological Survey list of critical minerals this month. While 75 million ounces have left Comex vaults since early October, fears of a sudden premium for US silver have caused some traders to hesitate before shipping metal out of the country.\n",
      "Silver has surged more than 90% this year, as investors pile into alternative assets in a wider retreat from government bonds and currencies, dubbed the debasement trade. Optimism about the metal’s fundamental supply-and-demand balance have also supported prices — the market is set to see a fifth consecutive supply deficit this year. Unlike gold, a large share of silver demand is industrial, with applications in solar cells and electronics.\n",
      "Copper’s latest leg-up comes after miners, smelters and traders met in Shanghai this week, with discussions focused on a tightening market. Kostas Bintas, the high-profile head of metals at Mercuria Energy Group Ltd., renewed his bullish prediction, warning that a rush to ship metal to the US risks draining the rest of the world’s inventories.\n",
      "“This is the big one,” he said in an interview at the end of an industry conference in Shanghai organized by the Center for Copper and Mining Studies, or CESCO. “If the world keeps going like this we will be left without copper cathodes in the rest of the world.”\n",
      "Traders have been ramping up shipments to the US in recent weeks to once again capitalize on a big premium for metal on the Comex, fueled by ongoing uncertainty about the potential for future tariffs.\n",
      "Friday’s surge is “a response to very bullish headlines coming out of CESCO Shanghai, focusing on the pull of US units into the country creating tightness ex-US,” said Natalie Scott-Gray, senior metals analyst at StoneX Financial Ltd.\n",
      "“This comes against a backdrop in which we already, for year-end, have a perfect storm bull narrative,” she said, citing the anticipation of tariffs, an improving macroeconomic outlook and supply disruptions.\n",
      "Copper has found further support in rising expectations of further monetary easing by the Fed, which could propel growth and demand in the world’s biggest economy.\n",

      "West Texas Intermediate edged down to settle below $59 a barrel, after earlier gaining as much as 1.7%, to close out the longest streak of monthly drops since March 2023. The commodity slid to intra-day lows minutes before settlement as The New York Times reported that US President Donald Trump and Venezuelan counterpart Nicolás Maduro discussed a potential meeting in a call last week. A de-escalation between the Trump administration and the oil-rich South American country would sap a major risk premium out of oil prices.\n",

      "An end to the conflict would have significant ramifications for the oil market. Russia is one of the world’s leading producers and its flows are subject to heavy Western sanctions. Any easing of curbs following a deal could unleash restricted supplies to buyers such as China, India and Turkey.\n",
      "“It may take some time for a potential Ukraine-Russia peace deal to go through as Russia may look to store up some barrels instead of rushing to sell them,” said Mukesh Sahdev, the founder and chief executive officer of XAnalysts Pty, an energy market analysis firm.

      "OPEC+ will meet virtually this Sunday, and market expectations are that the group will stick to its plan to pause crude output increases in early 2026.\n",
      "Oil prices are supported by news of reduced crude exports from Russia, after last Wednesday's data from Vortexa showed Russia's oil product shipments fell to 1.7 million bpd in the first 15 days of November, the lowest in more than 3 years.  Ukraine has targeted at least 28 Russian refineries over the past three months, exacerbating a fuel crunch in Russia and limiting Russia's crude export capabilities.  Ukraine knocked out 13% to 20% of Russia's refining capacity by the end of October, curtailing production by as much as 1.1 million bpd.  New US and EU sanctions on Russian oil companies, infrastructure, and tankers have also curbed Russian oil exports.\n",

      "Earlier this month, OPEC revised its Q3 global oil market estimates from a deficit to a surplus, as US production exceeded expectations and OPEC also ramped up crude output.  OPEC said it now sees a 500,000 bpd surplus in global oil markets in Q3, versus last month's estimate for a -400,000 bpd deficit.  Also, the EIA raised its 2025 US crude production estimate to 13.59 million bpd from 13.53 million bpd last month.\n",
      "OPEC+ at its November 2 meeting announced that members will raise production by +137,000 bpd in December but will then pause the production hikes in Q1-2026 due to the emerging global oil surplus.  The IEA in mid-October forecasted a record global oil surplus of 4.0 million bpd for 2026.  OPEC+ is trying to restore all of the 2.2 million bpd production cut it made in early 2024, but still has another 1.2 million bpd of production left to restore.  OPEC's October crude production rose by +50,000 bpd to 29.07 million bpd, the highest in 2.5 years.\n",

      "European soccer club FC Barcelona has come under criticism after signing a $22 million, three-year global sponsorship deal with little-known crypto firm Zero-Knowledge Proof (ZKP), based in the Pacific island of Samoa.\n",
      "Xavier Vilajoana, a former board member of the club, told the Financial Times that striking a deal with the crypto startup was a sign of financial “desperation,” pointing to “red flags” in the company's background and calling the decision \"incredibly concerning.\"\n",
      "In a tweet, Vilajoana pointed to how ZKP's X account had only 33 followers at the time of the official announcement of the partnership, and he criticized the company’s alleged association with former kickboxer and controversial influencer Andrew Tate. Tate posted an endorsement of the Zero-Knowledge Proof technology on his X page, which was later shared by the company on its Telegram page, with an additional ZKP logo.\n",
      "“It seems like a bad joke, but unfortunately it's real,” commented Vilajoana.\n",
      "The club, which is thought to be under severe financial pressure, is holding €469 million of debt ($542 million).\n",
      "Zero-Knowledge Proof appears to have launched its social media channels and white paper early this November. Details about its ownership and funding structure aren’t clear from its website, though it says it is regulated under Samoan law. The firm is currently in the process of conducting its initial coin offering. ZKP’s namesake cryptographic technology has been possible since the early ’90s.\n",
      "The Financial Times noted that it was unable to find public information about some of the firm’s management, including Jeff Wilck, its head of blockchain.\n",
      "In an official statement, FC Barcelona said it “has no connection whatsoever with the company’s token,” and that the club hasn’t discussed the existence or issuance of this token during sponsorship discussions.\n",
      "“The club has no responsibility for, or involvement in, the issuance or management of this token, nor does it use the associated technology,” said the club.\n",
      "Harry Halpin, CEO of blockchain-privacy firm Nym Technologies, said he would be skeptical of any company “which appeared out of nowhere and claimed to provide privacy via zero-knowledge proofs.”\n",
      "What are Zero Knowledge Proofs?\n",
      "“There are only about 50 programmers alive, I suspect, who can actually understand the math and code production-ready zero-knowledge proof systems.”\n",
      "He added that most of them already work at established companies like privacy-centric Ethereum layer-2 Aztec, blockchain protocol Anoma, privacy-focused layer-1 blockchain Aleo, and the Electric Coin Company, which is behind the Zcash privacy coin.\n",

      "(Bloomberg) -- The Chicago Mercantile Exchange restored trading operations in time to wrap up a holiday-shortened week in the US, recovering from an hours-long technical outage that had disrupted multiple financial markets across Asia and Europe.\n",
      "The exchange’s Globex Futures & Options markets, which handles futures, options, and commodities trading and accounts for 90% of CME Group’s volume, opened at 8:30 a.m. New York time. Volume remained light across many markets, with at least four traders noting delays in trading for Treasury futures and options tied to the Secured Overnight Financing Rate.\n",

      "A halt lasting around 10 hours triggered widespread frustration among market participants as they found themselves unable to trade contracts tracking the S&P 500 Index and multiple other assets ahead of month-end on one of the world’s largest derivatives exchanges. The outage stemmed from cooling problems at a crucial data center in the Chicago area.\n",
      "“I woke up thinking my Wi-Fi was out,” said Ritik Katte, chief investment officer at MCD Capital, a London-based investment firm.\n",
      "CME Direct, a platform the company offers for users to trade its markets, also eventually resumed operating after delays.\n",
      "The disruption lasted some three times longer than a similar disruption caused by a technical error in 2019 and underscores the reach of CME Group and its Globex electronic trading platform. Bourses operated by CME include the Chicago Board of Trade, the New York Mercantile Exchange and the Commodity Exchange.\n",
      "The cause of the outage was a cooling-system malfunction at a data center in Aurora, Illinios, according to facility operator CyrusOne, which is owned by KKR & Co. and BlackRock Inc.’s Global Infrastructure Partners.\n",
      "The Aurora complex has served as the primary hub of digital operations for CME Group for nearly two decades. The 450,000-square-foot facility is famous among high-frequency traders and Wall Street firms, who’ve jostled for position around the site to gain an advantage over competitors. Traders want to be close to the data center to minimize the distance data must travel in order to save microseconds.\n",
      "The disruption unfolded in the hours following the US Thanksgiving holiday Thursday, when stock and bond markets there were closed. While activity was expected to be subdued on Friday, a shortened trading day, the glitch added extra complications, particularly for investors looking to make month-end adjustments by rolling positions from one contract to another.\n",
      "“We’ve had to trade some cash Treasuries today and it was noticeably thinner and wider,” said James Athey, a portfolio manager at Marlborough Investment Management Ltd. “Month-end, day after Thanksgiving, CME down. It’s not an ideal combo!”\n",
      "The outage shows how one single point of failure can upend markets from commodities to foreign exchange and fixed income. It also raises questions about CME’s contingency plans and the exchange’s coordination with CyrusOne.\n",
      "Critical Decision\n",
      "While CME’s disaster-recovery plan includes moving to a data center in the New York area, the exchange opted to restart its matching engine from Aurora, according to a person familiar with the matter. The decision was made because the information the exchange had at the time signaled that the cooling issue would be resolved more quickly than it was, the person said.\n",
      "CyrusOne said in a statement earlier on Friday that its teams were working “around the clock” to respond to the cooling system issue but didn’t respond to more detailed questions about the outage and why the recovery was so prolonged.\n",
      "For markets affected, the impact was significant. In London hours, trading of US Treasury futures was halted, gold saw erratic moves and US crude and palm oil on the Bursa Malaysia exchange were also affected.\n",
      "Concentrated Markets\n",
      "Some traders reported that volumes had shifted onto alternative platforms as liquidity and price transparency evaporated.\n",
      "The disruption “shows how concentrated futures markets really are — there just aren’t many alternative venues for the main products,” said Thomas Texier, group head of clearing at Marex Group Plc.\n",
      "November has been a volatile month for equities, with the S&P 500 slumping as much as 4.7% amid concerns about the path of Fed rate cuts and valuations of artificial intelligence-linked stocks. The index has clawed back those losses and volatility has been falling all week, back near October lows.\n",

      "Visits to Black Friday sales have fallen this year as shoppers weigh up the prospect of higher taxes after Rachel Reeves’s Budget.\n",
      "High streets and shopping centres saw a 3pc decrease in foot traffic on Friday compared to a year earlier, according to data from MRI Software, in partnership with Retail Economics.\n",
      "“It is not surprising: people’s household budgets are under pressure and discretionary spending is an area that is bound to be hit,” said Richard Hyman, a retail analyst.\n",
      "“The fact that the Budget was so close to Black Friday means that consumers would have been bombarded by the various ideas that were floated ahead of the Budget. Whether that was income tax or mansion tax – people did not expect that they would have more money to spend after the Budget.”\n",
      "Black Friday is a US import and marks the beginning of post-Thanksgiving sales. It’s meant to kickstart the festive shopping season. It has become important for British retailers in recent years as shoppers have come to expect it.\n",
      "Traditionally held in October, this year the Budget fell just two days before Black Friday. Analysts said the timing was likely to have deterred people from shopping.\n",
      "Mr Hyman said: “The Budget’s proximity to Black Friday has not helped. It is a bit of a reality check and has helped to reinforce the idea that we are not doing very well economically. Consumers are part of that and so it does not make sense to go out and spend a lot of money in the Black Friday sales.”\n",
      "Retailers outside London suffered the biggest declines in visits to the shops, with coastal and market towns like Cromer in Norfolk and Shrewsbury in Shropshire faring the worst.\n",
      "Visits to high streets and shopping centres in London were largely unchanged from last year.\n",
      "The West Midlands saw a decrease of over 11pc while regions in the North including Yorkshire experienced a 10pc slump.\n",
      "“The cost of living squeeze appears to be weighing on overall activity,” said Jenni Matthews, at MRI Software.\n",
      "“Retail footfall remains 3.3pc lower compared to Black Friday last year with high streets and shopping centres leading this decline whereas retail parks noticed a marginal 0.1pc increase in visits.”\n",
      "BRC Consumer Sentiment Monitor data from earlier in November indicated subdued appetite for Black Friday sales.\n",
      "Only 42pc of respondents said they expect to spend more than they budgeted, down from 50pc in 2024. Overall, there was a decrease in appetite for the sales across the board with people saying they were less likely to take advantage of the discounts.\n",

      "Sat, November 29, 2025 at 2:30 AM GMT+7\n",
      "Colombia’s Ecopetrol is pressing ahead with a 2026 spending plan of 22–27 trillion pesos ($5.9–$7.2 billion), essentially holding the line from this year despite a political climate that couldn’t be more hostile to hydrocarbons. The company says the money will be deployed “with discipline,” which in Ecopetrol-speak means: drill aggressively enough to keep the lights on, but not so aggressively that Bogotá accuses you of sabotaging the energy transition.\n",
      "The plan calls for 380–430 development wells next year, almost all in Colombia, plus a handful of exploratory wells. Around 70% of the total budget is earmarked for production, with Ecopetrol forecasting 730,000–740,000 boe/d in 2026 — basically the same level it fought to maintain in 2025 after hitting record H1 output of 751,000 boe/d. The kicker is that the entire plan is based on $60 Brent and a 4,050 peso exchange rate, both conservative assumptions that tell you the company expects no favors from the macro backdrop.\n",
      "The bigger story is what Ecopetrol’s spending says about Colombia’s bind. President Gustavo Petro has halted new exploration, banned fracking, and layered on new taxes that gutted foreign investment — all while proven reserves have shrunk to barely eight years of supply. Yet production remains the country’s main export earner and one of the last reliable sources of fiscal revenue. That contradiction leaves Ecopetrol doing the heavy lifting: sweating existing fields harder, squeezing lifting costs below $12/bbl, and leaning on U.S. Permian acreage to diversify away from Colombia’s political risk.\n",
      "The company’s partners have taken the hint. Foreign investment in Colombia’s oil sector has eroded for a decade, with majors scaling back or walking away entirely. Ecopetrol has responded by pursuing production-sharing deals on mature fields and doubling down on blocks like CPO-09, where its own finds are some of the few bright spots left.\n",
      "Ecopetrol’s 2026 blueprint isn’t trying to impress anyone; it’s a survival plan dressed up as a budget. The government keeps tightening the leash on exploration, reserves are shrinking, and foreign investors are jittery. Someone has to keep the barrels flowing, and right now that someone is Ecopetrol. The company is doing what it can with the ground it already controls: drill what’s drillable, squeeze every peso out of efficiency, and buy time for a country that hasn’t decided what should replace oil and still depends on it more than almost anything else.\n",

      "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-big-name-hedge-funds-191412047.html\n",

      "Hedge funds have been quick to use artificial intelligence to help their investing teams.\n",
      "The so-called smart money has also been quick to invest in the trend across public and private companies.\n",
      "Quant funds have used machine-learning techniques for years.\n",
      "Artificial intelligence has already changed the way many industries operate, and hedge funds are no exception.\n",
      "The $5 trillion field is diverse in the type of strategies different firms employ and the type of securities they invest in. But everyone wants to be the smartest manager in the world — or at least the best-informed.\n",
      "To do that, funds have pumped resources into building out generative AI capabilities and use cases. Many firms, especially quantitative traders, are expanding initiatives they were already pursuing in areas such as machine learning. And nearly every firm is putting capital behind the trend that has dominated the public and private equity markets for several years now.\n",
      "Business Insider rounded up how some of the biggest and well-known managers are leveraging and backing the development of AI. It's an extensive, but not exhaustive, rundown.\n",
      "It is, first and foremost, about the data.\n",
      "Hedge funds have spent countless hours and astronomical amounts of money to get more information than their rivals as fast as possible. Their insatiable appetite for new and unique data has created a thriving alternative data industry, which is filled with firms scouring the world for new information to sell.\n",
      "As Umesh Subramanian, the chief technology officer of Ken Griffin's $69 billion Citadel, said at a Bloomberg event in October, the data firms like his are now consuming is in petabytes. A single petabyte is 1 million gigabytes and can store hundreds of millions of photos or hundreds of thousands of high-definition movies.\n",
      "The only reason funds like Citadel are able to consume this amount of information without feeling overwhelmed is because of AI. And, given the hypercompetitive nature of the industry, even the slightest advantage over a competitor is worth the cost.\n",
      "\"It's an arms race to be able to consume the right kind of data in the right kind of way to be able to make the right decisions,\" Subramanian said.\n",
      "$29 billion hedge fund Balyasny has built an AI bot that it believes will be able to do the grunt work that typically falls to senior analysts — a potential huge timesaver for investment teams. The manager told Business Insider in 2024 that roughly 80% of the firm's staff use its AI tools, which include the internal chatbot BAMChatGPT, and recently hired Matthew Henderey, one of the CIA's AI developers, as a data science executive.\n",
      "Balyasny isn't the only firm that has its own chatbot. Man Group and Viking Global have also developed their own internal offerings.\n",
      "Quant funds like D.E. Shaw, Bridgewater, and Two Sigma and proprietary trading firms and marketmakers like Jane Street, Citadel Securities, and Hudson River Trading have been at the cutting edge of AI and machine learning for years.\n",
      "For example, Two Sigma's Mike Shuster, who is the head of the quant's core AI team, said at a Columbia University event in November 2024 that his firm had been using generative AI for more than five years at that point. Bridgewater launched a $2 billion fund in the summer of 2024 that is run by machine learning; the manager's CEO, Nir Bar Dea, said this year the strategy produces \"a unique alpha uncorrelated to what our humans do.\"\n",
      "To stay at the vanguard of a new technology, you need top talent. These firms have often been able to lure top technical talent with eye-popping pay packages, but AI companies have been able to match, and in some cases, surpass compensation offers.\n",
      "As Business Insider reported, young quants drawn to the work AI startups are doing now \"don't even have to take a pay cut\" to choose Silicon Valley over East Coast trading floors.\n",
      "One of the reasons AI startups like OpenAI and Anthropic can afford hedge-fund talent is the tens of billions of capital that have been invested into them by big-name venture capital firms, as well as Tiger Cubs like Tiger Global, Coatue, and D1. Tiger Cubs are hedge funds with connections to the billionaire Julian Robertson and his firm, Tiger Management, that often focus on growth stocks in industries such as technology.\n",
      "Stockpicking funds like the Tiger Cubs have increasingly turned their attention to the AI trend in the public and private markets. Stocks like Nvidia, AMD, and Korean chipmaker SK Hynix are often significant holdings in their public portfolios, alongside tech giants such as Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta.\n",
      "Maverick, a smaller Tiger Cub run by Lee Ainslie, focuses less on picking the winners and losers among AI players and more on supporting the chipmaking ecosystem. The firm's private fund, Maverick Silicon, which invests in that space, is run by one of the firm's longtime investors, Andrew Homan.\n",
      "Steve Cohen, whose $40.5 billion Point72 has dozens of teams that invest in equities, was so convinced by AI's potential that he created a standalone strategy in October 2024, named Turion, a play on the famous computer scientist Alan Turing's name, to invest in the space. Point72 rarely offers new funds outside its flagship.\n",
      "Turion, which is run by portfolio manager Eric Sanchez, has outperformed the manager's flagship offering in 2025.\n",
      "While some firms have turned over investing decision-making to AI, other industry leaders are not yet convinced that the machines can outperform the market.\n",
      "Citadel's Ken Griffin said at an October conference that AI can not yet beat the markets. Man Group's Numeric unit has created an internal \"large language model-based workflow\" called AlphaGPT that \"still requires human oversight and strategic direction.\" Elliott's Paul Singer said in a podcast at the start of the year that AI's use cases are \"way exaggerated.\"\n",
      "There's no doubt that funds are using AI more than ever before and processing more data than ever imagined. However, human creativity remains important for investment giants, and, for the most part, AI is seen as a tool, not a replacement, for flesh-and-blood traders.\n",
      "At a London quant conference in October, the conclusion many systematic funds reached is that humans, not machines, are the edge required to beat the markets, Business Insider reported.\n",
      "\"Our key takeaway so far is that AlphaGPT doesn't replace human judgment but amplifies it. The most effective use of the system involves human researchers working alongside AI, with each contributing their unique strengths,\" a pair of Man Numeric executives wrote in a note on AlphaGPT from earlier in November.\n",
      "\"Numeric Humans provide strategic direction, market context, and final decision-making, while AlphaGPT handles the heavy lifting of data processing, hypothesis generation, and initial analysis.\"\n",

      "Sugar also has carryover support from Wednesday, when StoneX cut its Brazil 2026/27 Center-South sugar production estimate to 41.5 MMT from a September estimate of 42.1 MMT.\n",
      "Recent news that India's food ministry is considering boosting the price of ethanol used for gasoline blending is bullish for sugar, as it could encourage India's sugar mills to divert more cane crushing toward ethanol production rather than sugar, thereby reducing sugar supplies.\n",
      "Sugar prices have support from November 14, when India's food ministry said it would allow mills to export 1.5 MMT of sugar in the 2025/26 season, below earlier estimates of 2 MMT.  India introduced a quota system for sugar exports in 2022/23 after late rain reduced production and limited domestic supplies.\n",
      "On the bearish side for sugar, the International Sugar Organization (ISO) last Monday forecast a 1.625 million MT sugar surplus in 2025-26, following a 2.916 million MT deficit in 2024-25.  ISO said the surplus is being driven by increased sugar production in India, Thailand, and Pakistan.  In August, ISO had previously forecast a 231,000 MT deficit for the 2025-26 marketing year.  ISO is forecasting a +3.2% y/y rise in global sugar production to 181.8 million MT in 2025-26.\n",
      "The outlook for robust global sugar supplies has hammered sugar prices since early October.  On November 13, London sugar posted a 4.75-year nearest-futures low (SWZ25), and on November 6, NY sugar prices slumped to a 5-year nearest-futures low (SBH26), mainly due to higher sugar output in Brazil and talk of a global sugar surplus.  Sugar trader Czarnikow on November 5 boosted its global 2025/26 sugar surplus estimate to 8.7 MMT, up +1.2 MMT from a September estimate of 7.5 MMT.\n",
      "The outlook for record sugar output in Brazil is bearish for prices.  Conab, Brazil's crop forecasting agency, on November 4 raised its Brazil 2025/26 sugar production estimate to 45 MMT from a previous forecast of 44.5 MMT.  Unica recently reported that Brazil's Center-South sugar output in the second half of October rose by +16.4% y/y to 2.068 MT.  Also, the percentage of sugarcane crushed for sugar by Brazil's sugar mills in the second half of October increased to 46.02% from 45.91% the same time last year.  In addition, cumulative 2025-26 Center-South sugar output through October rose +1.6% y/y to 38.085 MMT.\n",
      "Signs of a larger sugar crop in India, the world's second-largest producer, are undercutting prices after the India Sugar Mill Association (ISMA) on November 11 raised its 2025/26 India sugar production estimate to 31 MMT from an earlier forecast of 30 MMT, up +18.8% y/y.  The ISMA also cut its estimate for sugar used for ethanol production in India to 3.4 MMT from a July forecast of 5 MMT, which may allow India to boost its sugar exports.\n",
      "The outlook for higher sugar exports from India is negative for sugar prices, as abundant monsoon rains may produce a bumper sugar crop.  On September 30, India's Meteorological Department reported that cumulative monsoon rainfall as of that date was 937.2 mm, 8% above normal, marking the strongest monsoon in five years.  On June 2, India's National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories projected that India's 2025/26 sugar production would climb +19% y/y to 34.9 MMT, citing larger planted cane acreage.  That would follow a -17.5% y/y decline in India's sugar production in 2024/25 to a 5-year low of 26.1 MMT, according to the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA).\n",
      "The outlook for higher sugar production in Thailand is bearish for prices.  The Thai Sugar Millers Corp on October 1 projected that Thailand's 2025/26 sugar crop will increase by +5% y/y to 10.5 MMT.  On May 2, Thailand's Office of the Cane and Sugar Board reported that Thailand's 2024/25 sugar production rose +14% y/y to 10.00 MMT.  Thailand is the world's third-largest sugar producer and the second-largest exporter.\n",
      "The USDA, in its bi-annual report released May 22, projected that global 2025/26 sugar production would climb +4.7% y/y to a record 189.318 MMT and that global 2025/26 human sugar consumption would increase +1.4% y/y to a record 177.921 MMT.  The USDA also forecast that 2025/26 global sugar ending stocks would climb by +7.5% y/y to 41.188 MMT.  The USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) predicted that Brazil's 2025/26 sugar production would rise by 2.3% y/y to a record 44.7 MMT.  FAS also predicted that India's 2025/26 sugar production would increase by 25% y/y to 35.3 MMT, driven by favorable monsoon rains and increased sugar acreage.  In addition, FAS predicted that Thailand's 2025/26 sugar production will increase by +2% y/y to 10.3 MMT.\n",

      "Trading of futures and options was halted due to a fault at a data center, spilling over into multiple markets and affecting contracts covering trillions of dollars.\n",
      "More than nine hours after the first alert appeared on the CME website on Thursday evening in the US, the company said services were starting to come back.\n",
      "During the outage, there was disruption to S&P 500 Index futures as well as the EBS foreign exchange platform and everything from Treasuries to US crude oil.\n",
      "In Singapore, one oil trader said when the initial alert was issued around 10:30 a.m. local time on Friday, they thought it was a hoax because the trades and quotes were still streaming in. But a few minutes later, the screen suddenly froze and they were booted out of the Nymex platform. A trader in London thought he had Wi-Fi connection issues.\n",
      "With the go-to service out, screens that would usually be a flickering wall of numbers ground to a halt, and traders had to seek out other options to keep trading and operating.\n",
      "“It’s pretty annoying. We wanted to price some equity index options,” said Gerald Gan, deputy chief investment officer at Singapore-based Reed Capital Partners. “My provider is scouring for alternatives, but I doubt the liquidity would be as ample as CME.”\n",
      "Such reactions reflect how CME — which started in the late 1800s as the Chicago Butter and Egg Board — has grown to become an integral part of the global market machinery and a crucial part of traders’ daily work. On average in October, derivatives trading volumes amounted to more than 26 million contracts every day, according to data from the group.\n",
      "On Nov. 20, open interest in CME’s US Treasury futures and options set an all-time high of 35.1 million contracts. About $1 trillion of notional value is traded daily in the E-mini S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures alone.\n",
      "Exchange outages have occurred frequently in recent years, with technology issues affecting pricing across platforms globally.\n",
      "In June 2024, a glitch during a software update in June 2024 led the New York Stock Exchange to erroneously halt trading on about 40 stocks and display odd trades showing a 99% drop in prices. Earlier in the year, tech issues disrupted premarket Nasdaq trading for almost three hours.\n",
      "In Europe, London Stock Exchange Group Plc suffered three outages in a few months at the end of 2023.\n",
      "The latest CME malfunction is far longer than an hours-long outage in 2019, which will mean questions for the company about its contingency plans.\n",
      "On LinkedIn, one employee at commodity trader Glencore commented “Real Black Friday” in response to a post on the issue.\n",
      "Quiet Day\n",
      "Friday was expected to be a relatively subdued day for stock markets, with no US economic data scheduled and no Federal Reserve speakers.\n",
      "While some in the market said lower-than-normal liquidity because of Thanksgiving and half-day trading would limit volatility, there was also frustration about the challenges of trading without indications on US price action.\n",
      "“Given the shortened session, the lack of data today and little volatility in markets given yesterday’s holiday, you couldn’t have asked for a better day for this to happen as volumes would have already been light,” said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group. “On the other hand, on a day when liquidity is already scarce, this only made getting trades done harder.”\n",
      "The outage meant limited trading in Treasury futures, and cash bonds traded sporadically. There are alternative methods to hedge trades, such as through swap markets, which became more active following the start of trading in London, according to traders.\n",
      "“I’m glad this isn’t happening on a ‘Liberation Day’ type event,” said Ritik Katte, chief investment officer at MCD Capital, a London-based investment firm.\n",
      "Futures for European and UK bond markets trade on a different exchange and were unaffected.\n",
      "In the foreign exchange market, one trader said when trading opened at 8 a.m. in London, some platforms initially showed elevated bid-offer spreads.\n",
      "“We typically use derivatives for tactical trades but it’s obviously impossible this morning,” said Amelie Derambure, a portfolio manager at Amundi SA. “Thankfully, it’s a quiet day. It would have been quite a handicap had it been a busy day.”\n",
      "Some said they were staying away given the risks posed by the outage on a day when trading was already expected to be thinner.\n",
      "“I am wary about trading on such an illiquid day, so I would not have wanted to trigger trades anyway,” said Rajeev De Mello, chief investment officer at Gama Asset Management. “And with this outage, all the more so.”\n",

      "Friday's fall in the dollar index (DXY00) to a 1.5-week low also sparked some short-covering in cocoa futures.\n",
      "Shrinking ICE cocoa inventories are also supportive of cocoa prices.  ICE-monitored cocoa inventories held in US ports fell to an 8.5-month low of 1,709,185 bags on Wednesday.\n",
      "An excessively short position by funds in London cocoa could exacerbate any short-covering rally.  Last Friday's weekly Commitment of Traders (COT) report showed funds boosted their net-short position in London cocoa futures by +3,737 to 22,748 net-short positions, the most in more than four years.\n",
      "The outlook for ample global cocoa supplies has weighed on prices.  Last Wednesday, cocoa prices tumbled to 1.75-year nearest-future lows on expectations of a bumper cocoa crop in West Africa.  Reports from Ivory Coast cocoa farmers stated that cocoa trees are doing well, and recent dry weather helped harvested beans dry, while cocoa farmers in Ghana said favorable weather is allowing cocoa pods to develop quickly.\n",
      "Chocolate maker Mondelez recently said that the latest cocoa pod count in West Africa is 7% above the five-year average and \"materially higher\" than last year's crop.  The harvest of the Ivory Coast's main crop has just begun, and farmers are optimistic about its quality.\n",
      "Cocoa prices are also under pressure after the European Parliament on Wednesday approved a 1-year delay to the deforestation law, keeping cocoa supplies ample.  The EU regulation, known as EUDR, aims to tackle deforestation in countries whose imports into the EU include key commodities such as soybeans and cocoa.  The delay of the EUDR will allow EU countries to continue importing agricultural products from regions in Africa, Indonesia, and South America where deforestation is occurring.\n",
      "Cocoa prices were undercut after the Trump administration announced on November 14 that it dropped the 10% reciprocal tariffs on commodities not grown in the US, including cocoa, and also the 40% tariff on food imports from Brazil.  Brazil is among the world's top 10 cocoa-producing countries.\n",
      "Reduced cocoa arrivals at ports in the Ivory Coast support cocoa prices.  Monday's government data showed that Ivory Coast farmers shipped 618,899 MT of cocoa to ports this new marketing year, from October 1 through November 23, down -3.7% from 642,500 MT in the same period a year ago.  The Ivory Coast is the world's largest cocoa producer.\n",
      "Weak global cocoa demand is bearish for prices.  On October 30, the CEO of chocolate-maker Hershey said chocolate sales this Halloween season were \"disappointing.\"  Halloween made up nearly 18% of annual US candy sales in 2024, second only to Christmas.  Meanwhile, the Cocoa Association of Asia on October 17 reported that Q3 Asia cocoa grindings fell by -17% y/y to 183,413, the smallest grindings for a Q3 in 9 years.  The European Cocoa Association on October 16 reported that Q3 European cocoa grindings fell -4.8% y/y to 337,353 MT, the lowest for a third quarter in 10 years.  The National Confectioners Association reported that Q3 North American cocoa grindings rose +3.2% y/y to 112,784 MT, but the addition of new reporting companies skewed the data.  In related news, North American sales volume of chocolate candy was down more than -21% in the 13 weeks ending September 7, compared to the same period last year, according to data from research firm Circana.\n",
      "A supportive factor for cocoa is lower cocoa production in Nigeria, the world's fifth-largest cocoa producer.  Nigeria's Cocoa Association projects that Nigeria's 2025/26 cocoa production will fall by -11% y/y to 305,000 MT from a projected 344,000 MT for the 2024/25 crop year.  In related news, Nigeria reported that its September cocoa exports were unchanged y/y at 14,511 MT.\n",
      "On May 30, the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) revised its 2023/24 global cocoa deficit to -494,000 MT, the largest deficit in over 60 years.  ICCO said 2023/24 cocoa production fell by -12.9% y/y to 4.368 MMT.  ICCO stated that the 2023/24 global cocoa stocks-to-grindings ratio declined to a 46-year low of 27.0%.  On Friday, the ICCO estimated a 2024/25 global cocoa surplus of 49,000 MT, marking the first surplus in four years.  ICCO also said global cocoa production in 2024/25 rose by +7.4% y/y to 4.69 MMT.\n",

      "Also, adverse global weather events that threaten to curb coffee output are positive for prices.  Arabica coffee has support due to dryness concerns in Brazil.  On Monday, Somar Meteorologia reported that Brazil's largest arabica coffee-growing area, Minas Gerais, received 26.4 mm of rain during the week ended November 21, or 49% of the historical average.  Robusta coffee has support amid forecasts of heavy showers in Vietnam's Dak Lak province, the country's biggest coffee-growing region, which will further delay the harvest.\n",
      "Shrinking ICE coffee inventories are supportive of prices.  The US tariffs imposed on US coffee imports from Brazil have led to a sharp drawdown in ICE coffee inventories.  ICE-monitored arabica inventories fell to a 1.75-year low of 398,645 bags last Thursday, and ICE robusta coffee inventories fell to a 6.5-month low of 4,530 lots on Friday.  American buyers voided new contracts for Brazilian coffee purchases due to the tariffs on US imports from Brazil, thereby tightening US supplies, as about a third of America's unroasted coffee comes from Brazil.  US purchases of Brazilian coffee from August through October, during which President Trump's tariffs took effect, dropped by 52% from the same period last year to 983,970 bags.\n",

      "Coffee prices found support after Conab, Brazil's crop forecasting agency, cut its Brazil 2025 arabica coffee crop estimate on September 4 by -4.9% to 35.2 million bags from a May forecast of 37.0 million bags.  Conab also reduced its total Brazil 2025 coffee production estimate by 0.9% to 55.2 million bags, from a May estimate of 55.7 million bags.\n",

      "Sat, November 29, 2025 at 1:44 AM GMT+7\n",
      "Retailers are marketing affordability and value to attract increasingly cautious consumers.\n",
      "Consumer sentiment is at historic lows, driving demand for lower prices and essentials.\n",
      "Retailers are adjusting their promotional strategies and messaging to encourage spending.\n",
      "Retailers are responding to the affordability crisis this holiday season.\n",
      "In recent earnings calls, Target, Walmart, and Sally Beauty Holding addressed the cratering consumer sentiment and discussed their pricing strategies as the busiest time of year for shoppers approaches.\n",
      "Consumers are feeling the pinch. According to the University of Michigan's survey of consumers, sentiment dropped to 51 points in November, which is the second-lowest score the index has ever recorded since 1952, narrowly topped only by a score of 50 in June 2022.\n",
      "Mark Cohen, the former director of retail studies at Columbia Business School, said that retailers are responding by investing more in lower-priced items and \"adjusting their assortments\" to give their customers the opportunity to buy from them at a lower price.\n",
      "\"Retailers have been getting more and more promotional for years in the main, but now they're doing it with their feet standing on thin ice because they don't know what to expect,\" said Cohen. \"The last thing they want is to have overhang inventory for the holidays when the season is over, so they have been discounting frantically.\"\n",
      "In Target's third-quarter earnings call, Rick Gomez, the executive vice president of Target, said that because consumer sentiment is \"at a three-year low amid concerns about jobs, affordability, and tariffs,\" shoppers are looking to \"celebrate with loved ones without overspending.\"\n",
      "\"Guests are choiceful, stretching budgets and prioritizing value,\" said Gomez. \"They're spending where it matters most, especially in food, essentials, and beauty, while looking for trend-right deals in discretionary categories.\"\n",
      "\"Given our focus on affordability, we recently lowered prices on thousands of everyday food and essential items to help families further manage their budgets,\" Gomez added.\n",
      "Target is struggling with declining sales and had to cut its profit guidance for the end of the year, but companies that are faring better have similar concerns.\n",
      "In their respective Q3 earnings calls, Home Depot said that \"consumer uncertainty and continued pressure in housing\" is driving down demand for larger home improvement projects, Lowe's is expecting comp sales to remain \"roughly flat\" due to \"a cautious consumer,\" and Sally Beauty Holdings said it saw shoppers \"leaning into value a bit more,\" especially for those with low-income.\n",
      "\"The disparity in wage growth between those cohorts was as large as it's been in almost a decade,\" said John David Rainey, CFO of Walmart, during the company's Q3 earnings call in reference to the relatively stagnant wage growth for low-income households.\n",
      "\"If pocketbooks are being stretched and consumers are being choiceful and value seeking, it stands to reason, if there's more pressure on the consumer, they're only going to become more so,\" Rainey added, citing the value Walmart provides as a reason why the company is gaining market share in this economic environment.\n",
      "The Federal Bank of New York wrote in its latest report that total household debt has reached a record high this year, totaling $18.59 trillion from July through September. Compared to the end of 2019, before the pandemic, overall debt levels have increased by $4.4 trillion.\n",
      "Not every retail company is feeling equally cautious this holiday season. Best Buy hiked its sales forecast on \"better-than-expected\" sales in the third quarter because of strong results across computing, gaming, and growth in wearables. Gap Inc., in its Q3 earnings call, said that external data points to \"macro pressure on the low-income consumer,\" but the company raised its full-year guidance.\n",
      "Dax Dasilva, the CEO of Lightspeed Commerce, a retail analytics company, told Business Insider that shoppers now are \"highly price-savvy\" and drawn to transparency in pricing and offers that are easy to understand.\n",
      "A consumer sentiment survey from Lightspeed Commerce found that of the 1,500 respondents in the US market, almost one in four of the surveyed individuals said they will use Black Friday only for everyday essentials, such as groceries and household basics, while 13% said they weren't planning to spend at all.\n",
      "\"The brands winning right now are those showing empathy, not extravagance,\" said Dasilva. \"Messaging that celebrates practicality like 'shop smarter,' 'stretch your dollar' resonates far more than indulgent tones like 'treat yourself.'\"\n",
      "Dasilva added that despite low consumer sentiment, sectors like bike, outdoor, sports, and self-care are still performing resiliently, which gives some indication toward what consumers are currently willing to invest in.\n",
      "Jean-Pierre Dubé, professor of marketing at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, said that retailers are developing strategies to offer deals without permanently lowering prices, in fear that this may \"recalibrate consumer price expectations\" to be lower.\n",
      "\"Retailers like promotional discounts because they are temporary in nature, facilitating a necessary price reduction without leading the consumer to expect the lower price to persist,\" said Dubé.\n",
      "Dubé pointed to the rise of the \"everyday-low-price\" model, now widely used by chains like Walmart and T.J. Maxx, which he said is experiencing surprisingly good results because of the guarantee of consistent low prices within a specified period, without needing to wait for a big annual sale.\n",
      "\"Depending on how much inventory retailers acquired for the holiday season,\" Dubé added, \"I anticipate some exceptionally aggressive discounts and promotions.\"\n",

      "Ford workers told their CEO ‘none of the young people want to work here.’ So Jim Farley took a page out of the founder’s playbook\n",
      "Fortune \n",
      "<fin-streamer active=\"\" class=\"percentChange yf-90gdtp\" data-field=\"regularMarketChangePercent\" data-pricehint=\"2\" data-symbol=\"AMZN\" data-trend=\"txt\" data-tstyle=\"default\"></fin-streamer>\n",

      "Sasha Rogelberg\n",
      "Sat, November 29, 2025 at 1:43 AM GMT+7\n",
      "Ford CEO Jim Farley learned from older employees that some young workers at the carmaker were taking shifts at Amazon to make ends meet, he said at the Aspen Ideas Festival. Farley said he drew on founder Henry Ford’s decision to raise factory wages to $5 a day in 1914 to make temporary workers into full-time employees. Young people have previously eschewed manufacturing jobs due to low wages.\n",
      "Some economists credit carmaker Henry Ford for jump-starting the American middle class in the 20th century when, in January 1914, he hiked factory wages to $5, more than double the average wage for an eight-hour work day.\n",
      "More than 100 years later, facing the reality of many employees “barely getting by,” Ford CEO Jim Farley said he took a page out of the founder’s playbook.\n",
      "The carmaker’s chief executive recognized the need to make a change in his workplace when he spoke to veteran employees during union contract negotiations and learned young Ford employees were working multiple jobs and getting inadequate sleep due to low wages, Farley said in an interview with journalist and biographer Walter Isaacson at the Aspen Ideas Festival earlier this year.\n",
      "“The older workers who’d been at the company said, ‘None of the young people want to work here. Jim, you pay $17 an hour, and they are so stressed,’” Farley said.\n",
      "Farley learned some workers also held jobs at Amazon, where they worked for eight hours before clocking in to a seven-hour shift at Ford, sleeping for only three or four hours. At a Ford Pro Accelerate event in September, the CEO said entry-level factory workers told him they were working up to three jobs.\n",
      "As a result, the company made temporary workers into full-time employees, making them eligible for higher wages, profit-sharing checks, and better health care coverage. The transition was outlined in 2019 contract negotiations with the United Auto Workers (UAW), with temporary workers able to become full-time after two years of continuous employment at Ford.\n",
      "“It wasn’t easy to do,” Farley said. “It was expensive. But I think that’s the kind of changes we need to make in our country.”\n",
      "Ford’s own decision to double factory wages in 1914 was not altruistic, but rather a strategy to attract a stable workforce, as well as provide a stimulus for his own workers to be able to afford Ford products.\n",
      "“He said, ‘I’m doing this because I want my factory worker to buy my cars. If they make enough money, they’ll buy my own product,’” Farley said. “It’s a self-fulfilling prophecy, in a way.”\n",
      "Farley, a proponent of growing U.S. manufacturing productivity to support the essential economy, has advocated for young workers to have strong trade experiences. Earlier this month, he sounded the alarm on the shortage of manual labor jobs, saying in an episode of the Office Hours: Business Edition podcast that Ford had 5,000 open mechanic positions that have remain unfilled, despite an up-to $120,000 salary for the role.\n",
      "“Our governments have to get really serious about investing in trade schools and skilled trades,” he said at the Aspen Ideas Festival. “You go to Germany, every one of our factory workers has an apprentice starting in junior high school. Every one of those jobs has a person behind it for eight years that is trained.”\n",
      "Despite the U.S. seeing 3.8 million new manufacturing jobs by 2033, according to Deloitte and the Manufacturing Institute, the younger generation of workers has largely turned away from the career path. As as some ditch college degrees, Gen Z enrollment in trade schools is on the rise, but the newest generation entering the workforce is largely eschewing factory jobs, citing low wages, according to a 2023 Soter Analytics study. U.S. manufacturing jobs in the U.S. have an average $25-per-hour wage—about $51,890 per year—falling short of the average American salary of $66,600.\n",
      "American carmakers like Ford may be trying to make it appealing for young workers to embark on manufacturing careers, but they are still not immune to workers’ grievances over wages. In 2023, thousands of UAW members, including 16,600 Ford employees, went on strike before reaching a contract deal in October of that year, which, beyond increasing wages, also further decreased the period of time necessary for a temp worker to become full-time.\n",
      "Farley called the strike “completely unnecessary” from management’s perspective and maintained the onus of improving trade workers’ wages isn’t just on Ford.\n",
      "“We’re not just going to hope it gets better,” he said. “We have the resources, and we have the know-how, after 120 years, to solve these problems, but we need more help from others.”\n",

      "December 10-year T-notes (ZNZ5) on Friday closed down -6.5 ticks.  The 10-year T-note yield rose by +2.5 bp to 4.019%.  T-notes gave up an early advance on Friday and moved lower, and the 10-year T-note yield rebounded from a 1-month of 3.960% and moved higher, as strength in stocks undercut safe-haven demand for T-notes.  Also, Friday’s +1% rally in WTI crude oil to a 1-week high has boosted inflation expectations, a bearish factor for T-notes.\n",
      "T-notes initially moved higher on Friday due to optimism that the Fed will cut interest rates at next month’s FOMC meeting, as the chances of a 25 bp rate cut to the fed funds target range have risen to 84% from 30% last week.  Trading volume in Treasury futures was subdued as trading resumed this morning after being down since Thursday evening due to a technical outage at the CME.\n",

      "Consumer sentiment is in the dumps and sources say it's a signal worth watching.\n",
      "Market pros say the Fed won't be able to ignore the red flags being raised by US households.\n",
      "\"Sentiment isn't wobbling at the edges or drifting lazily lower. It has collapsed,\" one CIO said.\n",
      "Worsening consumer sentiment might be among the biggest red flags in the economy right now, according to one CIO.\n",
      "It's hard to open a newspaper or turn on a TV without seeing an expert making grim predictions for why the US economy is teetering on the brink of recession. Top economists such as Mark Zandi have repeatedly emphasized that the US is on the brink, with just a few things holding back a downturn.\n",
      "Even as delayed economic data is finally released and the economy moves on from the recent government shutdown, other experts say the data tells a grim story, particularly when it comes to the health of the consumers.\n",
      "After the University of Michigan's consumer sentiment survey dropped to one the lowest levels ever earlier this month, the Conference Board on Tuesday showed similar results from its survey. It's confidence gauge fell to the lowest level since April, on a mix of inflation and labor market anxieties.\n",
      "While few companies are hiring, many have opted to lay off significant chunks of their staff, leaving large groups without an income as the holiday season approaches. And according to multiple experts, confidence in the economy is reaching dangerously low levels.\n",
      "\"Consumer sentiment is at its lowest level ever,\" stated Mark Malik, CIO of Siebert Financial. \"Sentiment isn't wobbling at the edges or drifting lazily lower. It has collapsed. It has broken through historical floors.\"\n",
      "Siebert added that the Federal Reserve needs to start paying attention to this trend before things worsen. He noted that, monetary policy, which is intended to stabilize prices, is not working as intended.\n",
      "\"When consumer sentiment across all cohorts is flashing deep red, that is not nothing. It means households feel squeezed. It means the labor market doesn't feel as strong from the inside as the headline numbers suggest,\" Malik added.\n",
      "Tie Lasater, CEO of Lasater Capital, also sees waning sentiment as a warning sign that markets and economists should be paying attention.\n",
      "\"Historically, sentiment alone doesn't cause recessions, but sharp, sustained collapses in confidence often precede or accompany economic slowdowns,\" Lasater said. \"When households lose confidence, they shift into defense.\"\n",
      "He added that when consumers adopt a defensive mindset, they scale back spending, negatively impacting businesses, and potentially spurring layoffs. The negative feedback loop reinforces the initial pessimism, pushing consumer sentiment down even further.\n",
      "Noah Yosif, chief economist at the American Staffing Association who previously served at the Bureau of Labor Statistics, echoed the sentiments. He highlighted the concerning trend of employees at all levels exhibiting clear caution.\n",
      "\"Consumer sentiment is often a noisy predictor because feelings about the state of the economy vary substantially across different income levels and generations; so uniform pessimism across multiple demographics suggests a rare alignment of multiple economic pressures that cannot be dismissed as a temporary mood or isolated hardship,\" he stated.\n",

      "Happy Black Friday to Barchart readers everywhere. I hope Thanksgiving was a great day spent with friends and family, enjoying each other’s company, and watching a lot of football.\n",
      "Typically, on Friday, I write something that caught my attention about Thursday’s unusual options activity. However, with the markets closed yesterday, I thought I’d do something a little different.\n",
      "AVGO Iron Condor Could See a 60% Return in 3 Weeks\n",
      "Shorting Secured Out-of-the-Money Amazon Puts Works Here\n",

      "I’ve been writing about investments full-time or part-time since 2004. I’ve learned a lot over the last two decades. One of the things I’ve always tried to foster in my writing is accountability. When you make so many suggestions or recommendations to readers about stocks to buy or sell, inevitably, you are going to be wrong a great deal.\n",
      "Veteran credit investor Howard Marks likes to say that he has made five market calls in 50 years in the investment business. Buffett says that 12 decisions made over six decades explain all of his good fortune. Good investors usually have a great deal of humility. The same is true for the investment media.\n",
      "So, to make sure I remain humble, I thought I’d look back at some of my suggestions and recommendations from my unusual options activity commentary in October and November—both good and bad.\n",
      "All investors should reflect on their good and bad calls. It helps us learn and be better.\n",
      "Enjoy the rest of your Thanksgiving weekend!\n",
      "On Nov. 6, I wrote about potential holiday income from Lemonade (LMND), the New York-based insurtech. Specifically, I looked at five bullish income-generating strategies: Covered Call, Cash-Secured Puts, Bull Call Spread, Bull Put Spread, and Iron Condor.\n",
      "From the Nov. 5 closing price of $78.73, LMND stock is down 1.5%. In today’s pre-market, it looks to get those losses back.\n",
      "The good news about all five strategies is that their expiration dates are Dec. 19, so there are still three weeks of time decay left.\n",
      "For example, I suggested selling Dec. 19 $55 cash-secured puts for $120 in premium income. According to Wednesday’s trading, the bid price on the two largest trades was $0.30, or about one-quarter of what they were three weeks earlier. That’s a win.\n",
      "As a bit of a thought experiment, I thought I’d recommend a longer-duration expiry for my Invesco Nasdaq QQQ ETF (QQQ) covered strangle. As I said in my article, 20 to 60-day DTEs (days to expiration) make the most sense for this options strategy, so I was going way out on a limb.\n",
      "Based on the Nov. 6 closing price of $611.67, QQQ is up 0.4%; it’s barely moved, albeit with a fair bit of volatility in both directions.\n",
      "The covered strangle combines a covered call OTM (out of the money) with a cash-secured put OTM. I pointed out that if you bought 100 shares at $611.67 and sold a covered call with an $800 strike, your potential return if the shares moved up to $800 or more at expiration on Sept. 18, 2026, would be 31.9%.\n",
      "However, if you bought the shares at the April 52-week low of $402.39, your return would increase more than threefold. Of course, if the share price doesn’t move, you get to keep the $499 premium, for a 1% annualized return. Hardly worth your time.\n",
      "As for the cash-secured put, I suggested selling the $480 strike, which is 20.73% OTM, for a 3.5% annualized return. Also, not going to make you rich. The put trade in this instance provides a possible lower entry point for QQQ of $480. However, if the market falls apart, you could face a significant loss.\n",
      "The thought experiment failed because the reward wasn’t nearly lucrative enough to warrant the risk. Sometimes, best practices exist for a reason.\n",
      "On Nov. 13, I wrote about two unusually active options for Pfizer (PFE) and Bath & Body Works (BBWI). I wanted to know whether each was suitable for a long or short straddle.\n",
      "I concluded that the former was a short straddle and the latter was a long straddle. For this article, I’ll focus on BBWI. A long straddle involves buying a call and a put with the same strike price and expiration date.\n",
      "The unusually active option for BBWI was the Nov. 21 $21.50 put. So, the straddle involved buying a $21.50 put and a $21.50 call, both expiring on Nov. 21.\n",
      "The net debit for the hypothetical trade would be $3.05 [$1.50 ask price for put and $1.55 ask price for call] or 13.6% of the $22.40 Nov. 12 closing price. For the long straddle to be successful, its share price needed to be higher than the upper breakeven or below the lower breakeven at expiration in a little over a week.\n",
      "The upper and lower breakeven prices were $24.55 and $18.45, respectively. Bath & Body Works reported disappointing Q3 2025 results before the markets opened on Nov. 20. The shares lost 25% of their value, hitting a new 52-week low of $14.28. The shares closed the next day, on Nov. 21, at $14.85, below the breakeven.\n",
      "So, the call would have expired worthless, while the put would have generated a $3.60 ($360) profit [$21.50 strike price - $14.85 share price - $3.05 net debit], an annualized return of 4,785.6% [$3.60 profit / $3.05 net debit * 365 / 9].\n",
      "Honestly, the trade worked out, but I got lucky. I had no idea the company’s newish CEO would pull a mea culpa and admit it messed up with moves into adjacent businesses, etc.\n",
      "My final look back is my Oct. 31 article about Palantir (PLTR), Chipotle Mexican Grill (PLTR), and Constellation Brands (STZ). All three had unusually active options the day before. I’ve been bullish about Palantir for a long time, so I’ll focus on its stock and options.\n",
      "“I’ve been bullish about Palantir CEO and co-founder Alex Karp for some time. He’s a very bright individual who isn’t afraid to speak his mind. A recent CNBC article discussing the company’s shift in political support from Democrats to Republicans is something to worry about —but not for the reasons you might think,” I wrote on Halloween.\n",
      "On Oct. 31, Palantir had one unusually active option with open interest over 500, so I went with the Nov. 7 $207.50 call expiring in nine days.\n",
      "I suggested doing a covered call, which involved buying 100 Palantir shares for $19,455, and simultaneously selling one Nov. 7 $207.50 call for $515 in premium income.\n",
      "On Nov. 4, PLTR stock dropped by more than 8% on news that hedge fund manager Michael Bury, the guy behind the book The Big Short, had taken a short position in its stock, despite the company reporting excellent quarterly results. They’ve since dropped an additional 14%.\n",
      "The net debit of the covered call would have been $189.40 [$194.55 share price - $5.15 bid price]. The paper loss at expiration would be $22.51 or $2,251 [$166.89 share price at expiration - $189.40 net debit]. That’s a return of -11.9%.\n",
      "Live by the sword, die by it.\n",

      "One of Reform UK’s largest donors has bought a luxury London flat tied to a bankrupt Hong Kong property tycoon for around £42m.\n",
      "Bassim Haidar, a telecom entrepreneur who has donated £1m to the party, said on Friday that he had acquired the flagship property in Knightsbridge’s One Hyde Park development – paying a 30pc discount to the £60m it previously sold for.\n",
      "Located across an entire floor, the 9,000 sq ft apartment was put on the market in October after lenders seized it from the wife of Pan Sutong, formerly one of Asia’s richest men.\n",
      "Mr Haidar, 54, said he completed the deal having waited for the outcome of the Budget.\n",
      "“It represents an opportunity to acquire some assets in the UK right now and wait it out for the long term, so it’s a very long play, something that will play out for the next seven to 10 years,” he said.\n",
      "Born in Nigeria to Lebanese parents, Mr Haidar founded his first telecoms company aged 20 and went on to amass a fortune of close to £1bn, including around £80m of properties in central London.\n",
      "Until last year, his portfolio also included the superyacht on which Diana, Princess of Wales, holidayed with Dodi Fayed in 1997.\n",
      "Previously a major Tory donor, the entrepreneur defected to Reform UK in April and has backed Nigel Farage to be the country’s next prime minister.\n",
      "One Hyde Park was built by brothers Nick and Christian Candy, the former of whom is now treasurer of Reform UK.\n",
      "The flat was acquired in 2011 by an offshore company controlled by Liu Jianming, Mr Pan’s wife, for £60m. However it was repossessed after Mr Pan was declared bankrupt in Hong Kong in 2022 after defaulting on debts at his property empire.\n",
      "The property includes a wine storage system, five bedrooms, six bathrooms and a cinema room.\n",
      "Its steep drop in value is the latest sign of how far London’s high-end homes have tumbled since the heights of the capital’s house price boom.\n",
      "Average prices in London’s most exclusive neighbourhoods are 20pc below their previous peak in 2015, according to estate agency Knight Frank.\n",
      "Now though, clarity over the Chancellor’s Budget has begun to unclog a host of stalled high-end house sales.\n",
      "Prospective buyers had been spooked by speculation that the Chancellor would punish homeowners of high-value homes, including changes to capital gains tax relief and a levy on sellers of properties worth more than £500,000.\n",
      "Those rumours disrupted the most affluent areas of Britain, driving house prices down in the South of England for the first time in 18 months, according to Zoopla.\n",
      "The top end of Britain’s housing market has also been stung by the Chancellor’s decision to scrap the non-dom tax regime and put overseas assets within the scope of inheritance tax.\n",
      "Those measures have driven an exodus of wealthy individuals from Britain, with many choosing to move to places such as Dubai and Monaco.\n",
      "Representatives for Mr Pan declined to comment, while Candy Capital and Sotheby’s International Realty, which acted for the seller, were contacted for comment.\n",

      "Shares in BitMine (BMNR), the leading Ethereum treasury firm, are up 4.47% today and more than 27% over the last 5 trading days, now changing hands at $33.16.\n",
      "The firm, which is chaired by outspoken investor Tom Lee, has remained bullish on the second-largest crypto asset, consistently adding to its coffers despite ETH’s more than 38% drawdown from its August all-time high. BitMine holds over $11 billion worth of Ethereum.\n",
      "CleanSpark (CLSK) and Riot Platforms (RIOT) are up even more, jumping 12.27% and 7.8%, respectively since Friday’s opening bell. The pair have posted even larger gains over the last five days, highlighted by CleanSpark’s move of more than 54% during that time.\n",
      "That move though has only helped diminish some of its monthly losses, with shares of CLSK still down around 21% during that time, changing hands at $15.10.\n",
      "The roller coaster ride comes just a few weeks after the Bitcoin mining firm upsized a convertible notes offering to $1.15 billion, with nearly half earmarked for share buybacks at an average price of $15.03.\n",

      "Tilray Brands shares tumbled Friday ahead of a 1-for-10 reverse stock split set set to take effect after markets close next Monday, Dec. 1.\n",
      "In a reverse stock split, a company cuts the number of its outstanding shares and increases the per-share price proportionally.\n",
      "Nearly six months ago, Tilray Brands (TLRY) stockholders approved a 1-for-10 reverse stock split. Now the cannabis firm has given a date it will take effect, and shares are tanking.\n",
      "The stock lost over a fifth of its value in Friday's shortened trading session, bringing its losses in 2025 to nearly 40%. (Read our daily markets coverage here.)\n",
      "Tilray Brands, which describes itself as \"a global lifestyle and consumer packaged goods company at the forefront of the global cannabis, beverage, and wellness industries,\" announced late Wednesday that the reverse split will take effect after markets close next Monday, Dec. 1. When markets open Tuesday, its shares will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis under the same ticker symbol, but with a new CUSIP number, 88688T209.\n",
      "Starting Tuesday, every 10 shares of common stock will be automatically combined and converted into one, reducing the number of outstanding from about 1.16 billion shares to 116 million. Fractional shares will not be issued, Tilray said.\n",
      "In a reverse stock split, a company cuts the number of its outstanding shares and increases the per-share price proportionally. While the move won't change the overall value of Tilray investors' holdings, it will boost the price of each individual share.\n",
      "Tilray said it expects the change, which Tilray's stockholders had approved at a special meeting back in June, could make its stock \"more attractive to institutional shareholders\" and reduce expenditures associated with its annual meeting, \"resulting in up to $1 million in cost savings on an annual run rate basis.\"\n",
      "However, reverse stocks splits are typically viewed as a bearish signal by investors, as they could suggest a lack of confidence in the stock's upward trajectory. Shares of Tilray had been up nearly 60% for the year as recently as Oct. 9, two months after President Donald Trump said the White House would be \"looking at reclassification\" of marijuana, but have fallen since amid regulatory uncertainty as no final rule has been adopted.\n",

      "Gold (GC=F) futures settled near $4,240 per ounce on Friday, closing out their fourth straight month of gains and bringing the yellow metal back within shouting distance of its record high on firming expectations for a December rate cut.\n",
      "Dovish commentary from Federal Reserve officials has raised the odds that policymakers will decide to cut interest rates by at least 25 basis points next month. Since gold doesn’t produce income, its relative attractiveness improves when interest rates fall.\n",
      "Gold hit a record high of $4,336 per ounce on Oct. 20 before falling about 10% through the first week of November. This year, the price of gold has risen more than 60%.\n",
      "An easing in the US dollar (DX-Y. NYB) and expectations of continued fiscal spending and \"run-it-hot\" government policies heading into 2026 are also expected to support bullion prices.\n",
      "\"We have a tremendous deficit ... we also have a tremendous amount of government spending, and on top of that, we have a tremendous amount of central bank buying,\" Michele Schneider, Marketgauge.com chief strategist, told Yahoo Finance on Friday morning.\n",
      "On Thanksgiving, President Trump said he aims to end the income tax, citing revenue expected from his tariff policy.\n",
      "\"Over the next couple of years, I think we'll substantially be cutting, and maybe cutting out completely ... income tax,\" Trump said. \"We could be almost completely cutting it because the money we're taking in is going to be so large.\"\n",
      "Trump's comments come after floating the idea earlier this month of a tariff “dividend of at least $2,000” for non-high-income earners.\n",
      "“All of this [talk from Trump] is very inflationary, and that’s what gold is really responding to. I think $4,700 would be a good next target,” Schneider said, referring to her 2026 price forecast.\n",
      "Following the largest one-day sell-off in over a decade, Wall Street analysts have remained bullish on the price of gold. The precious metal remains on pace for its best year since 1979, driven by central bank purchasing and increased inflows into exchange-traded funds (ETFs).\n",
      "\"We still expect continued central bank buying, alongside private investor flows under Fed easing, to lift gold prices to $4,900 by end-2026, with significant upside if the private investor diversification theme were to gain more traction,\" Goldman Sachs analysts wrote earlier this month.\n",
      "Meanwhile, UBS recently raised its price target on the precious metal to $4,500 per ounce by mid-2026.\n",
      "\"Our view on gold remains bullish,\" UBS analysts wrote earlier this week. \"We think gold’s role as a portfolio diversifier and geopolitical hedge is undiminished.\"\n",

      "GMO warns that AI stocks are exhibiting the classic signs of being in a bubble.\n",
      "The firm sees parallels to the dot-com bubble, citing high valuations and speculation.\n",
      "Instead of AI, the firm likes developed market value stocks and non-US small-cap value.\n",
      "Jeremy Grantham's GMO has periodically warned of an AI bubble for years now, even while most market onlookers remained bullish. Now, as fears of overexuberance begin to grip the broader market, the famed asset management firm is reiterating its bearish call.\n",
      "\"AI looks like a classic investment bubble to us, with very high valuations and signs of rampant speculation,\" Ben Inker, the co-head of asset allocation at GMO, said in the firm's quarterly letter on November 21.\n",
      "\"Investors are so desperate to get in early on the next big thing that they've bid up the prices of quantum computing stocks 1200% or more over the past year, and at valuations that make Palantir look like a value stock,\" he continued. \"It certainly looks like a bubble to us, although I don't believe I'll convince any true believers in the AI version of 'this time it really is different' of that fact.\"\n",
      "GMO's call is not one on the broader market, however. It's strictly on the AI trade. That means it thinks that there are plenty of opportunities elsewhere in the stock market, and you don't have to move a majority of your portfolio into safer assets, like would have been prudent before the 2008 and 2021 crashes.\n",
      "Compared to the stock market bubbles of 2000, 2008, and 2021, Inker said the current environment is most similar to the dot-com bubble.\n",
      "And that \"should be a relief to the agnostic investor,\" he wrote. \"While dynamic, valuation-driven asset allocation saved many investors considerable pain in all three bubbles, only in the 2000 event was it possible to spare yourself large losses without having to own a portfolio that would have been crazy to hold in any normal situation.\"\n",
      "That portfolio included REITs, international small-caps, government bonds, and emerging market debt and equity.\n",
      "Today, GMO sees the most attractive opportunities in developed market value stocks and non-US small-cap value stocks, particularly in Japan.\n",
      "\"For the agnostic investor who is worried that AI might be a bubble but isn't entirely convinced, the good news is that today, certainty is not required to move to a portfolio that is less dependent on the AI trade,\" Inker wrote, the emphasis his.\n",
      "\"Plenty of other risk assets are trading at fair or even compelling valuations, and even if today's financial markets turn out to be rationally priced, there is no long-run expected return give-up for tilting your portfolio away from the AI darlings and into those other assets,\" he added.\n",
      "Examples of funds offering exposure to the above trades include the Avantis International Small Cap Value ETF (AVDV) and the iShares MSCI Intl Value Factor ETF (IVLU).\n",

      "(Bloomberg) -- About 45 minutes west of downtown Chicago lies a rather unassuming, glass-encased data center that some of the world’s largest markets depend on. By one 2018 estimate, at least $25 quadrillion of notional trade volume passes through the facility every day.\n",

      "The Aurora, Illinois, complex has served as the primary hub of digital operations for the world’s largest futures exchange operator CME Group Inc. for nearly two decades. The 450,000-square-foot facility is famous among high-frequency traders and Wall Street firms, who’ve long jostled for position around the site to gain a leg up on competitors. At one point, DRW Holdings mounted an antenna on a utility pole near the complex to cut down on the latency. Rival Jump Trading bought property across the street for its own antenna. Scientel erected a tower, too.\n",
      "Traders want to be close to the data center to reduce latency, minimizing the distance data must travel in order to shave microseconds off their trades. As a former executive of the data center’s operator once put it: “If you read the book , you can get a real quick lesson on what’s going on.”\n",
      "On Friday, the data center — located in the Chicago suburb probably best known for serving as the setting of the comedy film — became infamous to all who trade across equities, foreign exchange, bonds and commodities markets globally. A malfunction in the cooling system at the complex took down virtually all CME futures and options trading platforms, wreaking havoc for traders around the world. The operator of the data center, CyrusOne, said that its teams were working “around the clock” to respond to the cooling system issue but didn’t respond to further questions.\n",
      "This critical piece of infrastructure to global markets dates back to 2009, when CME started building the facility to host its electronic trading infrastructure, essentially serving as the backbone for CME’s futures and options trading platform Globex.\n",
      "In 2016, CME decided it wanted to shift away from owning infrastructure and sold the site to Dallas-based CyrusOne. As part of the deal, CME agreed to rent space from CyrusOne for 15 years so it could continue to house the computers at the site that keep its markets running, essentially outsourcing its day-to-day operations.\n",
      "CyrusOne knew what it was getting into. Gary Wojtaszek, the company’s chief executive officer at the time, described the data center to analysts as “ground zero” for high-speed trading and the “epicenter for all the futures trading.” In laying out the business case for a new tower that the company was building there in 2018 to boost connectivity, he emphasized that “speed is of the essence there.”\n",
      "With that, CyrusOne added Aurora to a broader portfolio of roughly 50 data centers across the US, UK, Germany and Singapore that serve customers spanning the technology, financial services, energy, medical, research and consulting industries.\n",
      "CyrusOne’s business case is built on going after big clients like CME that are buying virtually all of the space in a data center, according to Tobias Bopp, a manager of strategy and transactions at the consulting firm EY-Parthenon. “They’re building a lot of new data centers, and their position in the market right now is pretty important,” Bopp said in an interview.\n",
      "Lauren Eccles, a senior principal consultant specializing in data center recruiting for First Point Group, described CyrusOne as one “the big boys in the game,” pointing to the company’s strong presence in Germany in particular. Generally speaking, she said, “They’re a big player, and they’ve got a really good name.”\n",
      "In 2021, that reputation caught the attention of private equity. As the artificial intelligence boom began sending data center demand soaring, KKR & Co. and Global Infrastructure Partners agreed to buy CyrusOne in a deal that was worth roughly $11.4 billion. It was held up at the time as an illustration of how private equity investors were looking to cash in on the surging computing needs of AI model developers and tech giants such as Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Meta Platforms Inc. Wojtaszek had resigned a year earlier.\n",
      "Explainer: CME Outage Shows Challenge of Keeping Data Centers Cool\n",
      "It wouldn’t be the only, or the largest, data center deal for GIP. This year, after BlackRock Inc. bought the investment firm, GIP agreed to buy Aligned Data Centers in a $40 billion deal, marking one of the asset manager’s largest infrastructure investments ever.\n",
      "KKR referred all questions on CyrusOne to the data center operator. A spokesperson for GIP owner BlackRock declined to comment.\n",
      "It’s unclear whether CyrusOne tried to migrate CME’s operations at Aurora to another data center after the cooling units failed on Thursday.\n",
      "And while CME’s disaster recovery plan calls for moving operations to a data center in the New York area, the exchange opted to restart its matching engine from Aurora, according to a person familiar with the matter. The decision was made because the information the exchange had at the time signaled that the cooling issue would be resolved more quickly than it was, the person said.\n",
      "According to CyrusOne’s website, the data center features additional chiller units to protect against failures.\n",
      "The cooling failure might suggest an issue with the design of the system, according to Thomas Solelhac, a partner at EY-Parthenon. “Normally, in data centers of this type, there is a lot of redundancy to avoid this kind of problem with power and cooling,” Solelhac said.\n",
      "CME had expected its 2016 deal with CyrusOne to open it up to more computing resources. While fighting a proposal by Illinois lawmakers to tax trading on exchanges in 2016, CME Executive Chairman Terry Duffy, who is now CEO, suggested that the firm’s deal with CyrusOne would give it access to CyrusOne’s other data centers and not just Aurora.\n",
      "“If we need to leave Illinois because of any irrational decisions coming out of the state,” Duffy had said at the time, “we have 29 data centers to choose from.”\n",

      "Corporate bankruptcies are rising in 2025, nearing a 15-year high, S&P reports.\n",
      "This year, we've seen numerous notable bankruptcies, including Spirit Airlines and Claire's.\n",
      "How bad is it? We break down the trends in 3 charts.\n",
      "If you watch the news, you have undoubtedly seen the stories of well-known companies closing stores or raising doubts about their ability to continue operating.\n",
      "Earlier this month, S&P's data tracking company seemed to confirm our worst fears, reporting that 2025 bankruptcies were nearing levels not seen since in 15 years, or since 2010, when the economy was still recovering from the Great Recession.\n",
      "Scary, right?\n",
      "Not so fast. While the trend is definitely pointed upward, it's not all doom and gloom. Here is what's happening in 3 charts:\n",
      "S&P Global Market Intelligence reported some 68 bankruptcies in October, bringing the 2025 total to 655 for the first 10 months of the year. Assuming the trend continues through November and December, 2025 will end the year with 792 bankruptcies. That's more companies having filed for bankruptcy protection than any year since 2010, when S&P tracked 828 corporate bankruptcies.\n",
      "S&P, which only tracks companies of a certain size, said it's seeing the most bankruptcies in the industrials sector (think manufacturing), followed by consumer discretionary (think fashion).\n",
      "This year's high-profile bankruptcy filings have included electric truck maker Nikola, Spirit Airlines, and fashion accessory retailer Claire's.\n",
      "While 2025 bankruptcies are now on track to reach their highest levels since 2010, they are still expected to be significantly lower than the levels reached at the height of the Great Depression.\n",
      "In 2008, the year Lehman Brothers failed, leading to massive bank bailouts, S&P tracked 5,335 bankruptcies. The next year, it tracked 5,026.\n",
      "By contrast, bankruptcies were relatively low leading up to the Fed's recent spate of rate hikes — hitting a nadir of just 372 in 2022, according to S&P's data.\n",
      "Bankruptcies have been rising since 2023, as the cost of borrowing has increased. (The Federal Reserve began slowly raising interest rates in 2022 in an effort to tamp down inflation.) Even so, 2025's bankruptcies could still come in below 2010.\n",
      "There are two common types of bankruptcy filings: Chapter 7 liquidation and Chapter 11 reorganization.\n",
      "The first usually signals that the filing company plans to shutter its doors and go out of business.\n",
      "A company that turns to Chapter 11 bankruptcy, by contrast, does so to hammer out plans to repay its creditors under court supervision. Under this scenario, a company may look to cut costs, including by closing doors; however, the goal is to emerge from bankruptcy as a healthier and stronger company.\n",
      "There have been periods when liquidations have been on par with or even exceeded reorganizations, including between 2021 to 2023, when S&P tracked 744 liquidations to 667 reorganizations.\n",
      "That trend appears to have reversed in the last two years, however. This year, the S&P has tallied 412 reorganizations versus 269 liquidations, suggesting more companies are turning to bankruptcy court as a way to reduce debt rather than close their doors.\n",

      "Bitcoin’s near-term fate remains one of the most popular markets among Myriad predictors. This time, predictors are asked whether the top crypto asset’s next move will be a pump to $100K or dump to $69K.\n",
      "BTC has been steadily gaining ground after a slide and liquidations sent it briefly below $82,000. After a 10% weekly rebound, predictors are leaning bullish, giving odds of a pump to $100,000 around a 74% chance as of Friday morning.\n",
      "That marks around a 24% increase in odds for the pump since the market was created. Analysts have cited waning institutional interest and the uncertainty of Federal Reserve policy as reasons for the fall—but have we reached selling exhaustion?\n",

      "The purchase comes with a few conditions, including the right for the UpOnly co-hosts to choose the guests of the show—though according to the NFT, they might “ask for some suggestions” if they like the purchaser.\n",
      "Since Fish has been playing the role of Coinbase customer support on X, some may infer that he is on good enough terms with the NFT purchaser and acquirer of his firm. But is his newly created professional relationship enough to summon Brian Armstrong on the first episode of the UpOnly return?\n",
      "That’s what predictors on Myriad are tasked with deciding. As of Friday morning, odds stand at nearly 60% “no,” with predictors leaning against preferential treatment that would thrust the Coinbase CEO into the guest seat for the first episode.\n",
      "Fish has said that the show will commence when they’ve figured out all eight guests, but early guest ideas from the Echo founder did not include Armstrong.\n",

      "The firm, which recently raised at around a $75 billion valuation, has offered crypto trading since as early as 2017 and this summer was rumored to be considering the launch of its own stablecoin.\n",
      "Since that time, predictors on Myriad have been asked whether or not the firm will announce one by the end of the year.\n",
      "In July, predictors briefly favored the chances of Revolut announcing a stablecoin launch. But for the bulk of the market’s existence, odds were strongly against the European fintech firm revealing a fiat-backed token, averaging around 75% “no,” until early October when odds moved to around a coinflip.\n",
      "Reasons for a strong odds move are not immediately apparent, but around the time of the move, the firm did gain approval to establish a bank in Colombia, where it said it aims to offer a “portfolio of innovative financial products.”\n",

      "Sales figures from at least two companies that track shopping are showing that Thanksgiving Day sales this year were up from last year.\n",
      "Shoppers spent a record $6.4 billion online on Thanksgiving Day, according to Adobe. That's up 5.3% from last year as shoppers took advantage of Cyber Week deals, Adobe said.\n",
      "The actual spend for the day was better than Adobe had forecast ($6.37 billion). Online sales peaked earlier in the day, Adobe said, with the most robust sales happening between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. Last year, the peak shopping hours were 8 p.m. to 10 p.m.\n",
      "“The magnitude of discounts was the big story on Thanksgiving yesterday, as retailers leaned into delivering great deals to drive consumer demand online,” Vivek Pandya, lead analyst for Adobe Digital Insights said in a press release. “This was further propped up by impulse-led mobile shopping and the use of generative AI which assisted shoppers in locating the best deals, two trends that helped deliver higher-than-expected overall spend on Thanksgiving.\"\n",

      "Adobe said it saw an uptick in large purchases for the home on Thanksgiving, as well as video games and electronics. Online sales for video game consoles rose by 740% versus average spending in October of this year. Refrigerators and freezer sales were up 720%.\n",

      "Recent news that India's food ministry is considering boosting the price of ethanol used for gasoline blending is bullish for sugar, as it could encourage India's sugar mills to divert more cane crushing toward ethanol production rather than sugar, thereby reducing sugar supplies.\n",
      "Sugar prices have support from November 14, when India's food ministry said it would allow mills to export 1.5 MMT of sugar in the 2025/26 season, below earlier estimates of 2 MMT.  India introduced a quota system for sugar exports in 2022/23 after late rain reduced production and limited domestic supplies.\n",
      "On the bearish side for sugar, the International Sugar Organization (ISO) last Monday forecast a 1.625 million MT sugar surplus in 2025-26, following a 2.916 million MT deficit in 2024-25.  ISO said the surplus is being driven by increased sugar production in India, Thailand, and Pakistan.  In August, ISO had previously forecast a 231,000 MT deficit for the 2025-26 marketing year.  ISO is forecasting a +3.2% y/y rise in global sugar production to 181.8 million MT in 2025-26.\n",
      "The outlook for robust global sugar supplies has hammered sugar prices since early October.  On November 13, London sugar posted a 4.75-year nearest-futures low (SWZ25), and on November 6, NY sugar prices slumped to a 5-year nearest-futures low (SBH26), mainly due to higher sugar output in Brazil and talk of a global sugar surplus.  Sugar trader Czarnikow on November 5 boosted its global 2025/26 sugar surplus estimate to 8.7 MMT, up +1.2 MMT from a September estimate of 7.5 MMT.\n",
      "The outlook for record sugar output in Brazil is bearish for prices.  Conab, Brazil's crop forecasting agency, on November 4 raised its Brazil 2025/26 sugar production estimate to 45 MMT from a previous forecast of 44.5 MMT.  Unica recently reported that Brazil's Center-South sugar output in the second half of October rose by +16.4% y/y to 2.068 MT.  Also, the percentage of sugarcane crushed for sugar by Brazil's sugar mills in the second half of October increased to 46.02% from 45.91% the same time last year.  In addition, cumulative 2025-26 Center-South sugar output through October rose +1.6% y/y to 38.085 MMT.\n",
      "Signs of a larger sugar crop in India, the world's second-largest producer, are undercutting prices after the India Sugar Mill Association (ISMA) on November 11 raised its 2025/26 India sugar production estimate to 31 MMT from an earlier forecast of 30 MMT, up +18.8% y/y.  The ISMA also cut its estimate for sugar used for ethanol production in India to 3.4 MMT from a July forecast of 5 MMT, which may allow India to boost its sugar exports.\n",
      "The outlook for higher sugar exports from India is negative for sugar prices, as abundant monsoon rains may produce a bumper sugar crop.  On September 30, India's Meteorological Department reported that cumulative monsoon rainfall as of that date was 937.2 mm, 8% above normal, marking the strongest monsoon in five years.  On June 2, India's National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories projected that India's 2025/26 sugar production would climb +19% y/y to 34.9 MMT, citing larger planted cane acreage.  That would follow a -17.5% y/y decline in India's sugar production in 2024/25 to a 5-year low of 26.1 MMT, according to the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA).\n",
      "The outlook for higher sugar production in Thailand is bearish for prices.  The Thai Sugar Millers Corp on October 1 projected that Thailand's 2025/26 sugar crop will increase by +5% y/y to 10.5 MMT.  On May 2, Thailand's Office of the Cane and Sugar Board reported that Thailand's 2024/25 sugar production rose +14% y/y to 10.00 MMT.  Thailand is the world's third-largest sugar producer and the second-largest exporter.\n",
      "The USDA, in its bi-annual report released May 22, projected that global 2025/26 sugar production would climb +4.7% y/y to a record 189.318 MMT and that global 2025/26 human sugar consumption would increase +1.4% y/y to a record 177.921 MMT.  The USDA also forecast that 2025/26 global sugar ending stocks would climb by +7.5% y/y to 41.188 MMT.  The USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) predicted that Brazil's 2025/26 sugar production would rise by 2.3% y/y to a record 44.7 MMT.  FAS also predicted that India's 2025/26 sugar production would increase by 25% y/y to 35.3 MMT, driven by favorable monsoon rains and increased sugar acreage.  In addition, FAS predicted that Thailand's 2025/26 sugar production will increase by +2% y/y to 10.3 MMT.\n",

      "Longer term, CVX is up 3.2% on a YTD basis, while the shares have declined 8% over the past 52 weeks. In comparison, the SPX has gained 15.8% in 2025 and rallied 13.6% over the past year.\n",

      "CVX stock has underperformed due to a combination of falling global oil prices and company-specific operational and legal challenges. The stock is highly sensitive to commodity price fluctuations, and as oil prices weakened throughout the year, Chevron's shares suffered. Additionally, the company faced a loss of high-margin production after its U.S. license for Venezuelan operations expired in May 2025, further pressuring cash flow. However, the Trump administration later issued a restricted license allowing Chevron to resume production and export operations in Venezuela.\n",

      "“With platforms set to keep a record of this information from January 1, 2026, ahead of sharing it with HMRC the year after, the tax office will be able to cross-check tax returns against the data they’ve received,” Seb Maley, CEO of tax insurance provider Qdos, told FT.\n",
      "British tax experts say that this gives crypto users, traders, and investors until the end of 2026 to get their digital asset affairs in order to avoid sanctions.\n",
      "The new HMRC guidelines align the U.K. with the OECD Crypto-Asset Reporting Framework (CARF), which is designed to bring greater transparency to the fast-growing digital asset market and is already being rolled out in the European Union, Canada, Australia, Japan, and South Korea, among others.\n",
      "Crypto exchanges, classified as \"Reporting Cryptoasset Service Providers,\" must send the information in full detail directly to the HMRC in 2027. That data will enable the HMRC to determine the amount of tax crypto users must pay. The HMRC will sanction non-compliant platforms.\n",

      "Gold has glittered this year. And there's good reason to expect the precious metal to continue hitting record highs in the year ahead.\n",
      "Several Wall Street firms issued reports this week showing that analysts and investors believe the price of gold will rise in 2026, with some forecasting it could hit $5,000 per troy ounce, implying upside of about 20%. Many of the factors that have led investors to pour money into the traditional safe-haven asset are likely to remain in play, experts say.\n",
      "Gold has hit a series of record highs this year amid economic and geopolitical uncertainty that isn't expected to subside anytime soon. Some prominent investors have recently recommended that investors should increase their allocation to gold. Meanwhile, many Americans have rushed to sell gold jewelry to take advantage of high prices.\n",
      "Goldman Sachs on Friday said that nearly 70% of institutional investors expect gold prices to continue rising, with 36% saying the price will top $5,000 by the end of 2026, according to a survey this month of more than 900 clients. Investors cited continued buying by central banks around the world and fiscal concerns as the biggest factors contributing to gold's rise.\n",
      "Gold was trading at $4,220 an ounce Friday morning. (Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's trading here.)That's down from a record high just below $4,400 set in October, but still 60% higher than where it started 2025. Gold's price surge has far outpaced the performance of the benchmark S&P 500 stock index.\n",
      "TradingView\n",
      "The weakness of the U.S. dollar, which has lost ground this year as concerns about rising U.S. government debt have grown, is also underpinning support for gold, along with concerns about geopolitical instability and stock market volatility.\n",
      "Deutsche Bank this week raised its 2026 gold price forecast to $4,450 from $4,000 previously, projecting a range of $3,950-$4,950.\n",
      "\"Third quarter supply-demand data supports a continued central bank bid. The positive structural picture shows inelastic demand from central banks and ETF investment diverting supply from the jewelry market,\" Deutsche Bank said in a note to clients. \"Also, overall growth in demand outpaces supply.\"\n",
      "UBS believes that further weakening in the dollar, lower bond market returns, geopolitical uncertainty and fiscal concerns will all continue providing support for gold. The bank maintains an 'Attractive' stance on gold with a $4,500 price target for mid-year 2026, according to a Friday report.\n",

      "Markets move fast. Keep up by reading our FREE midday Barchart Brief newsletter for exclusive charts, analysis, and headlines.\n",
      "Shrinking ICE cocoa inventories are also supportive of cocoa prices.  ICE-monitored cocoa inventories held in US ports fell to an 8.5-month low of 1,709,185 bags on Wednesday.\n",
      "An excessively short position by funds in London cocoa could exacerbate any short-covering rally.  Last Friday's weekly Commitment of Traders (COT) report showed funds boosted their net-short position in London cocoa futures by +3,737 to 22,748 net-short positions, the most in more than four years.\n",
      "The outlook for ample global cocoa supplies has weighed on prices.  Last Wednesday, cocoa prices tumbled to 1.75-year nearest-future lows on expectations of a bumper cocoa crop in West Africa.  Reports from Ivory Coast cocoa farmers stated that cocoa trees are doing well, and recent dry weather helped harvested beans dry, while cocoa farmers in Ghana said favorable weather is allowing cocoa pods to develop quickly.\n",
      "Chocolate maker Mondelez recently said that the latest cocoa pod count in West Africa is 7% above the five-year average and \"materially higher\" than last year's crop.  The harvest of the Ivory Coast's main crop has just begun, and farmers are optimistic about its quality.\n",
      "Cocoa prices are also under pressure after the European Parliament on Wednesday approved a 1-year delay to the deforestation law, keeping cocoa supplies ample.  The EU regulation, known as EUDR, aims to tackle deforestation in countries whose imports into the EU include key commodities such as soybeans and cocoa.  The delay of the EUDR will allow EU countries to continue importing agricultural products from regions in Africa, Indonesia, and South America where deforestation is occurring.\n",
      "Cocoa prices were undercut after the Trump administration announced on November 14 that it dropped the 10% reciprocal tariffs on commodities not grown in the US, including cocoa, and also the 40% tariff on food imports from Brazil.  Brazil is among the world's top 10 cocoa-producing countries.\n",
      "Reduced cocoa arrivals at ports in the Ivory Coast support cocoa prices.  Monday's government data showed that Ivory Coast farmers shipped 618,899 MT of cocoa to ports this new marketing year, from October 1 through November 23, down -3.7% from 642,500 MT in the same period a year ago.  The Ivory Coast is the world's largest cocoa producer.\n",
      "Weak global cocoa demand is bearish for prices.  On October 30, the CEO of chocolate-maker Hershey said chocolate sales this Halloween season were \"disappointing.\"  Halloween made up nearly 18% of annual US candy sales in 2024, second only to Christmas.  Meanwhile, the Cocoa Association of Asia on October 17 reported that Q3 Asia cocoa grindings fell by -17% y/y to 183,413, the smallest grindings for a Q3 in 9 years.  The European Cocoa Association on October 16 reported that Q3 European cocoa grindings fell -4.8% y/y to 337,353 MT, the lowest for a third quarter in 10 years.  The National Confectioners Association reported that Q3 North American cocoa grindings rose +3.2% y/y to 112,784 MT, but the addition of new reporting companies skewed the data.  In related news, North American sales volume of chocolate candy was down more than -21% in the 13 weeks ending September 7, compared to the same period last year, according to data from research firm Circana.\n",
      "A supportive factor for cocoa is lower cocoa production in Nigeria, the world's fifth-largest cocoa producer.  Nigeria's Cocoa Association projects that Nigeria's 2025/26 cocoa production will fall by -11% y/y to 305,000 MT from a projected 344,000 MT for the 2024/25 crop year.  In related news, Nigeria reported that its September cocoa exports were unchanged y/y at 14,511 MT.\n",
      "On May 30, the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) revised its 2023/24 global cocoa deficit to -494,000 MT, the largest deficit in over 60 years.  ICCO said 2023/24 cocoa production fell by -13.1% y/y to 4.380 MMT.  ICCO stated that the 2023/24 global cocoa stocks-to-grindings ratio declined to a 46-year low of 27.0%.  For 2024/25, ICCO estimated a global cocoa surplus of 142,000 MT, marking the first surplus in four years.  ICCO also said global cocoa production in 2024/25 rose by +7.8% y/y to 4.84 MMT.\n",

      "Rystad Energy\n",
      "Sat, November 29, 2025 at 12:00 AM GMT+7\n",
      "Global geothermal investment is entering a period of accelerated growth, with capital expenditure (capex) expected to climb about 20% annually through 2030, according to Rystad Energy’s latest geothermal economics model. This momentum comes as geothermal energy, produced by tapping heat from deep within the earth, is no longer defined only by mature hubs in Southeast Asia and the US. Interest in regions such as Africa and Europe has been building at a measured pace, contributing to a steady broadening of activity worldwide. Meanwhile, the distribution of spending remains relatively stable across development categories due to consistent cost structures in drilling, surface facilities and steamfield infrastructure.\n",
      "Currently, just over half of total spending goes toward surface facilities, while an estimated 47% is directed to subsurface work and about 2% is allocated to pre-final investment decision (FID) activities. This distribution is broadly consistent across most markets, making this cost structure a defining aspect of geothermal development. Even the relatively small share devoted to pre-FID work can represent a significant risk, as early exploration determines whether a project advances or is halted altogether. The distribution of costs helps explain why project timelines and financing needs remain relatively uniform  across regions, even as overall activity grows.\n",
      "Global investment in geothermal energy is gaining momentum as more projects move toward FID. Our research shows that geothermal energy is increasingly being tailored to regional needs, reflecting its dual role as a source of clean, reliable power and a provider of heat. In the US, growth is being driven by the expansion of enhanced geothermal systems (EGS) and rising demand for baseload power from data centers. Europe, on the other hand, is focusing on decarbonizing heat, while Southeast Asia is turning to geothermal to meet growing electricity demand. The sector’s longer-term potential in cooling applications is growing as well, a market set to expand alongside global data center activity that’s less considered,\n",
      "Alexandra Gerken, Vice President, New Energies Analysis, Rystad Energy\n",
      "Learn more with Rystad Energy’s Geothermal Solution.\n",
      "When comparing geothermal deployment across continents, Europe stands out as a market dominated by district heating, driven by ambitious decarbonization targets and extensive municipal heating networks. In contrast, Asia, particularly Indonesia, and North America focus primarily on electricity-generating geothermal projects, reflecting strong baseload power needs and abundant geological resources. This divergence shapes both installed capacity and investment patterns. Europe relies more on subsurface development for heating despite lower surface infrastructure costs, while Asia and North America exhibit a more balanced demand between drilling and surface power facilities.\n",
      "Beyond regional deployment differences, geothermal energy’s role as a clean, reliable source of baseload power is gaining importance. EGS reduces site dependence by requiring only hot rock rather than aquifers, unlocking additional clean power potential and providing stable baseload heat. The technology also shows long-term promise in cooling applications. Pilot projects in the Middle East are exploring its use for data centers, including the UAE’s first geothermal cooling plant, the G2COOL project.\n",
      "Further research from Rystad Energy, using a bottom-up approach, examines each geothermal asset and its individual cost components, including drilling operations, equipment, and surface infrastructure, rather than focusing solely on total project costs or subsurface development. Geothermal projects are primarily used for district heating systems or power generation, and the resource stands out as one of the few energy sources capable of providing clean baseload power, meaning it can deliver a steady and reliable energy supply.\n",
      "Costs are often expressed in “dollars per watt,” which indicates the investment required to produce one watt of energy. On this basis, district heating projects generally require about half the investment of geothermal power plants. This difference arises because heating systems do not require expensive turbine sets or complex surface infrastructure, which are essential for electricity generation. In contrast, geothermal power projects involve more extensive facilities and intricate designs, resulting in roughly $6 per watt for power versus around $3 per watt for district heating.\n",
      "These cost differences are important for policymakers, investors, and developers when assessing project feasibility, choosing technologies, and planning long-term geothermal development. Understanding these relative costs helps guide decisions on which projects to prioritize and how to maximize the value of geothermal resources.\n",

      "(Bloomberg) -- Silver jumped to a record, surpassing a peak set during a historic squeeze in the London market in October.\n",
      "Spot prices surged as much as 4.2% to about $55.66 an ounce. The white metal has been supported by rising hopes of a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut in December, inflows into bullion-backed exchange-traded funds and ongoing supply tightness.\n",

      "Friday also saw erratic price moves and thin liquidity in the silver market, after a chaotic hours-long halt to trading in futures on the CME’s Comex Exchange. By early morning US-time, most trading operations were back.\n",
      "Silver’s new high comes just over a month after a severe supply squeeze in the dominant silver trading hub in London last month, which sent prices soaring above levels in Shanghai and New York. While the arrival of nearly 54 million troy ounces has eased that squeeze, the market still remains markedly tight with the cost of borrowing the metal over one month hovering above its normal level.\n",
      "The flows into the London market have now put pressure on other hubs, including in China. Silver inventories in warehouses linked to the Shanghai Futures Exchange recently hit their lowest level since 2015, according to bourse data.\n",
      "“In the short term, a further price increase cannot be ruled out if registered silver inventories in China continue to decline,” analysts at Commerzbank AG wrote in a note earlier Friday.\n",
      "Traders are also monitoring any potential tariff on silver after the precious metal was added to the US Geological Survey list of critical minerals in November. While 75 million ounces have left the vaults of the Comex futures exchange in New York since early October, fears of a sudden premium for US silver have caused some traders to hesitate before shipping metal out of the country.\n",
      "Silver has surged almost 90% this year, as investors pile into alternative assets in a wider retreat from government bonds and currencies, dubbed the dabasement trade. Optimism about the metal’s fundamental supply and demand balance have also supported prices — the market is set to see a fifth consecutive supply deficit this year.  Unlike gold, a large share of silver demand is industrial, with applications in solar photovolaics and electronics.\n",
      "Spot silver was  higher at $ an ounce as of 4:52 p.m. in London. Spot gold rose  to $ an ounce.\n",

      "Under the end-July deal, the United States is broadly ‌imposing 15% import taxes on EU goods, while the European Union removes many of its duties on U.S. imports, a step that the European Parliament and EU governments need to approve.\n",
      "Envoys from the 27-nation bloc's governments reached agreement on a common position on ⁠the legislation on Friday.\n",
      "They agreed ‌to remove import taxes on U.S. industrial goods and to create tariff-free quotas for certain seafood and agricultural produce.\n",
      "However, they want ‍the EU to have the power to suspend fully or in part the changes to duties if they result in a surge of U.S. imports that causes or threatens to cause serious damage ​to EU industry. The European Commission would look into possible safeguards after a request ‌by EU members.\n",
      "The EU governments also want the Commission to monitor the impact of the tariff changes on the EU market and submit a report on this by the end of 2028, which would be just after the next U.S. presidential election.\n",
      "The final text of the legislation will follow negotiations between EU governments and the European Parliament.\n",
      "The parliament, which ⁠is due to establish its stance in late January,​ is looking at proposals for similar safeguards, along ​with an 18-month sunset clause and a mechanism to respond if the United States deviates from the EU-U.S. agreement.\n",
      "The parliament proposals ‍also call for the United ⁠States to remove the 50% steel and aluminium tariffs it introduced in August, after the deal was struck, on 407 'derivative' products, ⁠such as wind turbines and motorcycles.

      "Shrinking ICE coffee inventories are supportive of prices.  The US tariffs imposed on US coffee imports from Brazil have led to a sharp drawdown in ICE coffee inventories.  ICE-monitored arabica inventories fell to a 1.75-year low of 398,645 bags last Thursday, and ICE robusta coffee inventories fell to a 6.5-month low of 4,530 lots today.  American buyers voided new contracts for Brazilian coffee purchases due to the tariffs on US imports from Brazil, thereby tightening US supplies, as about a third of America's unroasted coffee comes from Brazil.  US purchases of Brazilian coffee from August through October, during which President Trump's tariffs took effect, dropped by 52% from the same period last year to 983,970 bags.\n",

      "Last month, I recommended shorting the Amazon, Inc. (AMZN) $235.00 strike price put option expiring today for a 1.36% yield over the month. It makes sense now to roll this put AMZN option over to the next month, as it might expire in the money.\n",
      "AMZN is trading at $232.03 in late trading today, as the market closes early. This is up from a recent low of $217.14 on Nov. 20.\n",

      "I had discussed shorting the $235.00 put option expiring today in the Oct. 31 Barchart article, “Amazon's Revenue Beat Surprises Analysts and Its Cash Flow Surges (Not FCF) - AMZN Stock Could Still Be Undervalued.”\n",
      "At the time, AMZN stock was at $245.90, and the put had a midpoint premium of $3.20. So, that provided an immediate yield to the short-seller of 1.36% (i.e., $3.20/$235.00).\n",
      "The $235.00 strike price put option will be exercised if AMZN stays at this level. However, it still trades for 4 cents, and the short-put investor can repurchase it.\n",
      "So, now it makes sense to roll this over to the next month.\n",
      "For example, the Dec. 26, 2025, put option period shows that the $225.00 strike price put option has a midpoint premium of $4.53.  That provides an immediate cash-secured put option yield of 2.0% (i.e., $4.53/225.00).\n",
      "That is a great way to play AMZN as it sets a new, potentially lower buy-in point. For example, the breakeven point, should AMZN fall to $225.00 on or before Dec. 26, is:\n",
      "$225.00 - $4.53 = $220.47\n",
      "That is over 5.1% lower than today's price.\n",
      "So, the investor makes 2.0% plus gets to potentially buy in at a lower point.\n",
      "I set the price target in my last article at $311.50 per share, so that provides a good upside:\n",
      "$311.50/$220.47 = +41.2% upside.\n",
      "The bottom line is that AMZN stock looks cheap here. One way to play it relatively safely is to short out-of-the-money (OTM) put options in one-month out expiry periods.\n",

      "OPEC+ will meet virtually this Sunday, and market expectations are that the group will stick to its plan to pause crude output increases in early 2026.\n",
      "Oil prices are supported by news of reduced crude exports from Russia, after last Wednesday's data from Vortexa showed Russia's oil product shipments fell to 1.7 million bpd in the first 15 days of November, the lowest in more than 3 years.  Ukraine has targeted at least 28 Russian refineries over the past three months, exacerbating a fuel crunch in Russia and limiting Russia's crude export capabilities.  Ukraine knocked out 13% to 20% of Russia's refining capacity by the end of October, curtailing production by as much as 1.1 million bpd.  New US and EU sanctions on Russian oil companies, infrastructure, and tankers have also curbed Russian oil exports.\n",
      "Oil prices have underlying support from ongoing geopolitical risks related to the US military buildup for a possible attack on Venezuela, the world's 12th-largest oil producer.\n",
      "Vortexa reported Monday that crude oil stored on tankers that have been stationary for at least 7 days rose +9.7% w/w to 114.31 million bbls in the week ended November 21, the highest level in 2.25 years.\n",
      "Earlier this month, OPEC revised its Q3 global oil market estimates from a deficit to a surplus, as US production exceeded expectations and OPEC also ramped up crude output.  OPEC said it now sees a 500,000 bpd surplus in global oil markets in Q3, versus last month's estimate for a -400,000 bpd deficit.  Also, the EIA raised its 2025 US crude production estimate to 13.59 million bpd from 13.53 million bpd last month.\n",
      "OPEC+ at its November 2 meeting announced that members will raise production by +137,000 bpd in December but will then pause the production hikes in Q1-2026 due to the emerging global oil surplus.  The IEA in mid-October forecasted a record global oil surplus of 4.0 million bpd for 2026.  OPEC+ is trying to restore all of the 2.2 million bpd production cut it made in early 2024, but still has another 1.2 million bpd of production left to restore.  OPEC's October crude production rose by +50,000 bpd to 29.07 million bpd, the highest in 2.5 years.\n",

      "Baker Hughes reported Wednesday that the number of active US oil rigs in the week ending November 28 fell by -12  to a 4-year low of 407 rigs.  Over the past 2.5 years, the number of US oil rigs has fallen sharply from the 5.5-year high of 627 rigs reported in December 2022.\n",

      "Mickey Drexler, the former CEO of Gap, told Yahoo Finance he learned from former Apple CEO Steve Jobs that micromanaging can be effective in getting customers what they want and deserve.\n",
      "One of the great debates in leadership is how much managing is too much. Psychologists argue micromanagement is harmful, saying it stifles creativity, dampens motivation, and reduces productivity.\n",
      "But some of the greats in business have shown micromanaging can lead to great success. Take Steve Jobs, for example. The former CEO of Apple, who died in 2011 from pancreatic cancer, continues to be revered as one of the greatest leaders in business history, but he’s also among some of the most famous micromanagers.\n",
      "“He’s a corporate dictator who makes every critical decision—and oodles of seemingly noncritical calls too, from the design of the shuttle buses that ferry employees to and from San Francisco to what food will be served in the cafeteria,” Adam Lashinsky wrote in a Fortune article about Jobs published just about a month before his death.\n",
      "But Jobs and other business leaders have shown micromanaging works and that it gets a bad rap. In an episode of the Opening Bid podcast with Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi, former Gap CEO Mickey Drexler made the case for this management practice, saying it was one of his major leadership takeaways from working with Jobs on the board of Apple.\n",
      "Jobs was “unique, once-in-a-lifetime, and [his death] a loss to America,” Drexler said. “He was a difficult person, mercurial, incredibly creative, and made sure the screws on all the products were horizontal.” Jobs also backed a “no-bozos policy,” or hiring people who actually knew how to manage others and get results.\n",
      "“Micromanaging is what it is. If you’re managing as a leader, set the tone. I’m proud to be a micromanager for what a customer sees, feels, and hears,” said Drexler, who also previously served as the CEO of J. Crew and currently serves as the chairman of Alex Mill. “So yes, I do micromanage, but [also] provide leadership. People know what is important.”\n",
      "Merchandising mastermind Drexler also previously worked at Ann Taylor, Bloomingdale’s, and Macy’s, and served on Apple’s board from 1999 to 2015.\n",
      "When Drexler first started serving on the board at Apple, Gap was worth $15 billion, which was bigger than Apple at the time.\n",
      "Apple is now a behemoth worth $4 trillion, with Jobs’ fingerprints still seen on its devices. Much of Jobs’ success had to do with bringing products to the market customers didn’t even know they wanted.\n",
      "“Some people say, ‘Give the customers what they want.’ But that’s not my approach,” Jobs once said. “Our job is to figure out what they’re going to want before they do.”\n",
      "By a slightly different token, Drexler is more focused on responding to customer concerns while also planning expectations for the future.\n",
      "“I think the world’s become kind of average in its standards,” Drexler said. “But average is not good enough to me. It’s [about] managing a customer’s expectations and what they should get: best-of-class. Don’t give a customer a reason not to buy something.”\n",
      "And while Drexler said he learned from Jobs, he’s stayed true to his own leadership style.\n",
      "“I didn’t learn to be extremely demanding [from Jobs],” Drexler said. “That’s what I’ve always been: a tough boss.”\n",

      "The data for air freight and container shipping “continue to signal expansion,” even as they weakened from June, “indicating a cooling-off in the transportation of goods worldwide,” the report said. The barometer’s automotive and electronics indexes stabilized and agriculture stayed in contraction, while new export orders showed improvement.\n",
      "“On balance, the indices show signs of moderation in global trade growth,” the WTO said.\n",
      "US President Donald Trump’s tariffs of 10% or higher on imports from most major trading partners disrupted international commerce through much of the year, spurring many American importers to front-load orders to avoid paying the import taxes, as well as shifting demand away from markets where the duties are the highest.\n",
      "US goods imports from China, for instance, sank 22% through August this year, but year-to-date shipments from markets including Vietnam, India, Thailand, Malaysia and Taiwan all gained more than 20%, according to data released in Washington this month.\n",

      "Fri, November 28, 2025 at 11:09 PM GMT+7\n",
      "Meesho, an Indian e-commerce rival to Amazon and Walmart-owned Flipkart, is set to launch a roughly $606 million IPO marked by token sell-downs from early backers and no sales from big names such as SoftBank and Prosus, signalling investor conviction in India’s booming online retail market at a time when tech shareholders globally have been cashing out at listings.\n",
      "The ten-year-old startup plans to price its shares at ₹105–111 each, raising ₹42.50 billion (about $475 million) in fresh capital and a small remainder through secondary sales, giving Meesho a post-issue valuation of roughly ₹501 billion (around $5.60 billion). The startup was last valued at about $5 billion in the private markets in 2021.\n",
      "Meesho is set to become the first major horizontal e-commerce platform in India to go public, with rival Flipkart expected to pursue an IPO next year and Amazon reportedly exploring a potential spin-off of its India operations, potentially for a future listing.\n",
      "Some of Meesho’s early shareholders are selling in the IPO, with Elevation Capital offloading just over 4% of its stake, Sequoia Capital spin-off Peak XV Partners selling around 3%, and Y Combinator trimming about 14%, per the prospectus (PDF). Larger backers — including SoftBank, Prosus, and Fidelity — are not selling any shares.\n",
      "Meesho’s offer-for-sale portion has been cut by about 40% from the draft prospectus filed in October to 105.5 million shares, worth ₹11.7 billion (roughly $131 million) at the top of the price band. The co-founders, Vidit Aatrey and Sanjeev Kumar, are, however, selling more than they had planned in the draft prospectus, with their combined offer rising to 32 million shares from about 23.5 million earlier, helping make up for reduced participation from other shareholders.\n",
      "Founded in 2015, Meesho began as a social commerce platform that targeted first-time online shoppers through WhatsApp before evolving into a full-fledged marketplace. It has since carved out a fast-growing niche with a low-cost model tailored to India’s price-sensitive consumers and small merchants — an approach that has increasingly pressured larger rivals Amazon and Flipkart. The Bengaluru-based company uses a commission-light model, earning primarily from logistics fees, advertising, and other services, while charging commissions on products sold through its separate Meesho Mall channel.\n",
      "Meesho reported revenue from operations of ₹55.78 billion (about $624.0 million) for the six months ended September 30, up from ₹43.11 billion (around $482.0 million) a year earlier, per its prospectus. Net merchandise value rose 44% year-over-year to ₹191.94 billion (roughly $2.15 billion). However, its losses widened, with Meesho posting a restated loss before tax of ₹4.33 billion (around $48.4 million) for the September 2025 half-year, compared with ₹0.24 billion (about $2.7 million) a year earlier.\n",
      "In the last 12 months, Meesho recorded 234.20 million transacting users — unique consumers who purchased at least one product on the platform. Over the same period, the company had 706,471 annual transacting sellers, defined as sellers who received at least one order in the year.\n",
      "Meesho also uses a sprawling creator network for product discovery, with more than 50,000 active content creators generating at least one placed order through their content over the past year.\n",
      "“Many Indians are only experiencing e-commerce for the first time on Meesho, and much like the rest of us, over the next decade, they will buy more and more things and more and more frequently on this platform,” Mohit Bhatnagar, managing director at Peak XV Partners, told TechCrunch. “That’s why long-term conviction is the reason to hold on to as much of our stake as we can hold on to.”\n",
      "Peak XV — which first invested in Meesho in 2018 during its Sequoia Capital India era and holds about 13% across its two vehicles — is selling around 17.38 million shares in the IPO.\n",
      "Meesho has positioned itself as a value-focused platform — unlike Amazon and Flipkart, which it sees as convenience-led players. In that respect, the company compares itself with other value-driven marketplaces such as Pinduoduo in China, Shopee in Southeast Asia, and Mercado Libre in Latin America.\n",
      "“If you look at the value-focused bucket, here, you are trying to appeal to mass market consumers selling all kinds of products and categories in a marketplace business model, which tends to be asset light,” Aatrey told reporters during Meesho’s press conference on Friday. “And the reason people come back is because they want access to more and more selection with the affordability value proposition.”\n",
      "Meesho also sees the IPO improving its ability to attract talent and strengthening confidence across its wider ecosystem, CFO Dhiresh Bansal told TechCrunch. He said a public listing boosts the company’s brand with job candidates — including those coming from big tech firms — and has a positive knock-on effect on consumers, sellers and logistics partners by reinforcing Meesho’s governance standards.\n",
      "The IPO will open for public subscription on December 3, with the anchor book scheduled for December 2. About 75% of the offer is reserved for qualified institutional buyers, 10% for retail investors and 15% for non-institutional investors.\n",
      "SoftBank did not respond to a request for comment.\n",

      "On Nov. 18, American mining company USA Rare Earth (USAR) completed the acquisition of Less Common Metals (LCM), a scaled-up ex-China rare-earth metal and alloy manufacturer. This purchase largely aligned with USAR’s strategy of creating a fully integrated, end-to-end rare-earth supply chain.\n",
      "A few days later, USAR announced that LCM has established a strategic partnership with chemical company Solvay to supply rare-earth metals to Permag, a leading magnetic equipment manufacturer.\n",

      "Rare-earth metals have come under the spotlight as U.S.-China trade relations enter a delicate phase. A trade truce between the countries has led to a selloff in domestic rare-earth stocks. However, this sense of security might not last long, as China continues to sharpen its strategies.\n",
      "For example, Beijing’s Validated End-User (VEU) system allows rare earth materials to flow exclusively to approved American companies focused solely on civilian use, while explicitly preventing the U.S. military and its extensive network of contractors from accessing these resources. The VEU strategy underscores the U.S. government’s investment. in the domestic rare-earth sector, positioning USAR as a critical source of rare-earth metals.\n",
      "Against this backdrop, we take a closer look at USA Rare Earth.\n",
      "Headquartered in Stillwater, Oklahoma, USA Rare Earth is building a fully integrated domestic supply chain for rare earth elements and neodymium magnets and targeting markets in defense, automotive, and technology. It operates the unique Round Top deposit in West Texas, a source of 15 of the 17 rare earth elements essential to high-tech industries and green energy.\n",
      "The Stillwater facility, designed for commercial-scale magnet manufacturing, aims to serve diverse sectors with innovative materials and will collaborate with local research institutions to advance magnet technology and industrial expertise. The company has a market capitalization of $1.6 billion.\n",
      "Over the past 52 weeks, USAR’s stock has gained 15.36%, driven by solid investor interest in rare-earth minerals critically needed for electric vehicles (EVs), renewable energy, and defense technologies. However, over the past month, the stock has plunged 47.26%, primarily due to a drop in share prices following its third-quarter results. USAR’s stock had reached a 52-week high of $43.98 on Oct. 13, but is down 72.17% from that level.\n",
      "On Nov. 6, USAR announced its third-quarter results for fiscal 2025. The company highlighted its operational strides, which included the identification of a flow sheet for the Round Top development process, with a pre-feasibility study expected to be completed in the second half of next year. The magnet facility at Stillwater remains on track for commissioning for commercial production in the first quarter of 2026.\n",
      "In addition, USAR signed a memorandum of understanding (MOU) with Enduro Pipeline Services to deliver U.S.-made neo magnets in early 2026. Also, it entered into a joint development agreement with ePropelled to establish a supply-and-purchase partnership for sintered neodymium magnets.\n",
      "On the Nov. 6 Earnings call, USAR’s new CEO Barbara Humpton also underscored USAR’s mission to build “a fully integrated U.S.-based rare earth material and magnet platform that supports national priorities.”\n",
      "On the other hand, USAR reported an adjusted loss per share of $0.25 in Q3 2025, which was a giant leap from the small $0.03 loss per share it had reported in Q3 2024. And, the figure missed the loss per share of $0.06 that Wall Street analysts had expected. Net cash used in operating activities grew 135.5% year-over-year (YOY) to $2.85 million. Contrarily, USAR ended the quarter with $257.61 million in cash and no significant debt.\n",
      "Wall Street analysts have a mixed view on USAR’s bottom line trajectory. For the current quarter, the company’s loss per share is expected to deepen by 100% YOY to $0.06. For fiscal 2025, loss per share is expected to increase by 100.07% to $0.65. However, it is expected to be followed by a 36.9% improvement, resulting in a loss per share of $0.41 in the subsequent fiscal year.\n",
      "Wall Street analysts are currently bullish on USAR’s stock. This month, analyst George Gianarikas from Canaccord Genuity reaffirmed a “Buy” rating on USAR’s stock, while raising the price target from $22 to $23.\n",
      "Last month, analysts at William Blair initiated coverage on USAR’s stock with an “Outperform” rating. Those analysts, including Neal Dingmann and Bert Donnes, believe that the company’s development of its Texas mine and the start of production at its neo magnet manufacturing site in Oklahoma should benefit the company.\n",
      "Wall Street analysts are favoring USAR’s stock, awarding it a consensus “Strong Buy” rating overall. Of the six analysts rating the stock, a majority of five analysts have rated it a “Strong Buy” and only one analyst is playing it safe with a “Hold” rating. The consensus price target of $22.75 represents an 83% upside from current levels. Moreover, the Street-high price target of $28 indicates a 125.3% upside.\n",
      "As the U.S. and China continue their tech and defense race, rare-earth metals and the companies that mine them might stand to benefit. USAR’s strategy of building a robust domestic mining supply chain for these metals could lead to lucrative future contracts. Therefore, post the LCM acquisition, the company might be a solid buy now.\n",

      "For years, when it was time for startups to start selling their product, they could turn to any number of traditional playbooks. But as with so many things, AI is changing how companies prepare to go to market.\n",
      "“You can do more with less than ever before,” Max Altschuler, general partner at GTMfund, told the audience at TechCrunch Disrupt last month.\n",
      "The challenge for founders and operators, though, will be threading the needle. While there has been some chatter of startups hiring developers more versed and loosing them on typical GTM problems, he said, there’s still a need for more specific domain expertise.\n",
      "“When you have great advisors around you can learn some of the tried-and-true playbooks. Those things haven’t gone out the window. I think it’s still necessary that you have a general understanding of how and why certain things work in marketing,” Altschuler said.\n",
      "Alison Wagonfeld, vice president of marketing at Google Cloud, said the craft of marketing is still very much required.\n",
      "“You certainly need the AI knowledge, the AI curiosity, the technologists, but also understanding what the purpose of marketing is, to understand customer insights, to do research, to see what great creative is like,” Wagonfeld said.\n",
      "Teams that adopt AI, though, can move more quickly “You can just get out there with so many more messages faster, and then you can think more holistically about what metrics am I driving for,” , she added.\n",
      "Marc Manara, head of startups at OpenAI, has found many startups have embraced AI in their GTM strategy, though it’s not necessarily with the sole focus of minimizing how many resources they put toward it.\n",
      "“There’s a movement of, yes, you can do more with less, but you can also be very focused with how you do it,” he said. “The degree of personalization and signal following that you can do with AI is differentiated now.”\n",
      "Specifically, he said there are tools that help build leads which are much more sophisticated than in the past. Rather than just a simple query of a database, AI prompts can help startups find prospective customers that fit a very specific set of requirements.\n",
      "Inbound marketing has changed, too, he added, by using the results of those prompts to qualify and score inbound leads “with a lot more precision could have been in the past.”\n",
      "When it comes time for a startup to begin crafting its go-to-market strategy, Wagonfeld said its important to consider what qualities it might want in a GTM team.\n",
      "“It’s a change in hiring perspective, where the past it was more about hiring specialists, people who really knew, sometimes even like a sub-specialty within marketing or within sales. And now it’s hiring for a sense of curiosity and understanding,” she said. “It’s almost the top thing to hire for now.”\n",

      "The Telegraph \n",
      "No tickers found\n",
      "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/reeves-proposes-workaround-state-pension-114457167.html\n",
      "Tim Wallace\n",
      "Fri, November 28, 2025 at 10:58 PM GMT+7\n",
      "Rachel Reeves has been accused of creating a “two-tier” tax system for pensioners that punishes workers with a private retirement pot.\n",
      "The Chancellor said on Thursday that retirees who only receive a state pension will not pay any tax for the rest of this parliament, even though payments will rise above the income tax threshold in 2027.\n",
      "However, the system being drawn up by the Treasury would mean that anyone with a private pension as well would pay tax on both that money and part of their state pension.\n",
      "A former pensions minister and Britain’s biggest long-term savings provider warned the policy would create unfairness in the system and increase the risk of mass withdrawals from small pension pots.\n",
      "The full new state pension will increase to £12,548 from next April.\n",
      "The minimum possible rise of 2.5pc in 2027 would take it above the £12,570 threshold of the tax-free personal allowance for the first time, to £12,862.\n",
      "This means if no action was taken, a pensioner with no other income would owe £58 of tax as a result, rising to £256 after the next general election.\n",
      "But the Chancellor promised on Thursday that affected pensioners would not have to pay any income tax at all.\n",
      "“In this parliament, they will not have to pay the tax. We are looking at a simple workaround at the moment,” she told ITV News.\n",
      "The Treasury said it will exempt people whose sole income is their state pension from a demand to pay tax, even on state pension income above the personal allowance.\n",
      "However, people who also have a private pension will face a tax demand on all earnings above £12,570.\n",
      "This will include both money above this level from the state pension, and their private income – meaning even someone with a small pot paying less than £1,000 a year would have to pay tax on the state pension.\n",
      "The Treasury confirmed that only pensioners whose “sole income is the basic or new state pension” will qualify for its proposed exemption.\n",
      "Millions of pensioners who have private savings, or are receiving income from a state earnings-related pension scheme (Serps) will still face demands from the taxman.\n",
      "Serps allowed people born in the early 1950s to claim an extra sum on top of their state pensions based on their lifetime earnings. The scheme ended in 2002.\n",
      "A Treasury spokesman suggested that retirees on the basic state pension and a low Serps income could also enjoy an exemption, although they refused to provide further details.\n",
      "Experts warned that the Chancellor risked creating chaos with the new policy.\n",
      "Sir Steve Webb, a former Lib Dem pensions minister, estimated that only one million pensioners would benefit from the new rules, out of a total of more than 13 million retirees.\n",
      "He said: “There is a risk of a two-tier system where people on the new state pension are protected whilst people on the old system and whose total pension is exactly the same are not protected.\n",
      "“This is a problem of the Government’s own making. There are already more than two million pensioners on the old state pension system whose pension is over the tax threshold, but no government has ever cared about this.”\n",
      "Standard Life owner Phoenix, which manages roughly £290bn of client cash, added that savers could cash in their private pension pots early to keep their state pension payments tax-free.\n",
      "Mike Ambery at Standard Life, said: “There are undoubtedly questions of fairness for those receiving small incomes from elsewhere who may end up paying a small amount of tax.\n",
      "“Pre-retirement age poverty is on the rise and a system like this would give people a small incentive to take any modest pension pots early.”\n",
      "Sir Steve, now a partner at consultants LCP, said it would discourage pensioners from opting for an annuity, where savers hand their pots over to a provider in return for an annual payment until they die.\n",
      "“It would provide an incentive for people to cash out their modest pension pots rather than turn them into regular income,” he said.\n",
      "The change will also create a disparity between how income from work and the state pension is taxed.\n",
      "Under the triple lock policy that ensures the state pension rises in line with the highest of prices, wages or 2.5pc, payments are projected to rise to £13,850 by the start of the next decade, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR).\n",
      "It means that workers face paying £250 more in tax than some pensioners in 2031.\n",
      "Ms Reeves said: “If you just have a state pension, you don’t have any other pension, we are not going to make you fill in a tax return. I make that commitment for this parliament.”\n",
      "She added: “2027 looks like the time it will cross over [the tax threshold]. We are working on a solution, as we speak, to ensure that we are not going after tiny amounts of money.”\n",
      "Labour’s new policy is reminiscent of the “triple lock-plus” proposed by the Conservatives before the 2024 election.\n",
      "Then-Prime Minister Rishi Sunak said that if his party won another term in power, “the tax-free allowance for pensioners [would] always rise with the highest of inflation, earnings or 2.5pc – so the new state pension doesn’t get dragged into income tax”.\n",
      "If the Chancellor were to follow this route, frozen thresholds would see workers pay more tax than pensioners to fund ever-higher benefit payments. The state pension is already guaranteed to rise faster than wages over time because of the triple lock.\n",
      "Pensioner spending is set to hit £195.4bn by 2030-31, making up almost half of the entire £406.2bn annual welfare bill, according to the OBR.\n",

      "Sandisk today joined the S&P 500, making it the latest company to join the benchmark U.S. index.\n",
      "The company's shares have been big gainers this year, pulling its market capitalization north of $31 billion.\n",
      "Shares of Sandisk climbed Friday as the data storage company joined the benchmark S&P 500 index.\n",
      "Sandisk's (SNDK) stock jumped close to 11% Friday morning before paring back much of its early gains. Its shares, which have been lifted by demand driven by the AI boom, are among the hottest around this year; the company was spun off from Western Digital (WDC) in February, and the stock is up more than 500% since. The company's market capitalization is above $31 billion, according to Visible Alpha data.\n",
      "Inclusion in a major index like the S&P 500 can be seen as a boon for a company's shares. In some cases investors even buy a non-member's stock in advance of an expected addition—at times finding themselves disappointed when another company is chosen.\n",
      "The spot in the S&P 500 was available because of the completion of Omnicom Group's (OMC) acquisition of Interpublic Group (IPG) earlier this week. The two previous companies to join the index, Solstice Advance Materials (SOLS) and Qnity (Q), were also the products of spinoffs.\n",
      "Investors generally cheer the addition of companies' shares to the S&P 500 and other major indexes, which is seen as giving them a short-term bump. Read Investopedia's full coverage of today's holiday-shortened trading here.\n",
      "A few other index changes are also happening today. PTC Therapeutics (PTCT) is taking Sandisk's spot in the S&P SmallCap 600; Upwork (UPWK) is also joining that index, replacing Premier, which was taken private.\n",

      "The dollar index (DXY00) today is up by +0.06%.  Month-end buying of the dollar is supporting modest gains, with today being the last trading day of November.  Forex trading was light, as futures and options trading on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange were halted until early this morning due to a data-center fault.  Strength in stocks today is limiting the dollar's upside.\n",
      "The dollar is also under pressure after Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that Kevin Hassett is leading the list of potential candidates to succeed Jerome Powell as US Fed Chair.  Hassett's nomination would be bearish for the dollar as he is seen as a dovish candidate.  Also, Fed independence would come into question, as Hassett supports President Trump's approach to cutting interest rates at the Fed, which Trump has long sought to control.\n",

      "The markets are discounting an 84% chance that the FOMC will cut the fed funds target range by 25 bp at the next FOMC meeting on December 9-10.\n",
      "EUR/USD (^EURUSD) today is down by -0.12%.  Dollar strength today is weighing on the euro.  Also, an unexpected decline in today's German Oct retail sales report is bearish for the euro.  Losses in the euro are contained after the Eurozone's Oct 1-year inflation expectations unexpectedly increased and the German Nov CPI rose more than expected, hawkish factors for ECB policy.\n",
      "Eurozone Oct 1-year inflation expectations unexpectedly increased to +2.8% from +2.7% in Sep, stronger than expectations of an easing to 2.6%.  Oct 3-year expectations remained unchanged at 2.5%, right on expectations.\n",
      "German Oct retail sales unexpectedly fell -0.3% m/m, weaker than expectations of an increase of +0.2% m/m.\n",
      "German Nov CPI (EU harmonized) rose +2.6% y/y, stronger than expectations of +2.4% y/y and the largest increase in 9 months.\n",
      "Swaps are pricing in a 3% chance of a -25 bp rate cut by the ECB at the December 18 policy meeting.\n",
      "USD/JPY (^USDJPY) today is down by -0.03%.  The yen is slightly higher today on better-than-expected Japanese industrial production and retail sales reports.  Also, the Nov Tokyo CPI remained above 2%, a hawkish factor for BOJ policy.  The yen fell back from its best level after T-note yields rose.\n",
      "Signs of weakness in Japan's labor market limited gains in the yen today after Japan's Oct jobless rate was unchanged at 2.6%, suggesting a weaker labor market than expected, with a decline to 2.5%.  Also, the Oct job-to-applicant ratio unexpectedly eased to 1.18, weaker than expectations of no change at 1.20.\n",
      "Japan's Oct industrial production unexpectedly rose +1.4% m/m, stronger than expectations of a -0.6% m/m decline.\n",
      "Japan Oct retail sales rose +1.6% m/m, stronger than expectations of +0.8% m/m and the biggest increase in 5 years.\n",
      "Japan Nov Tokyo CPI rose +2.7% y/y, right on expectations.  Nov Tokyo CPI ex-fresh food and energy rose +2.8% y/y, right on expectations.\n",
      "The Japan Oct jobless rate was unchanged at 2.6%, showing a weaker labor market than expectations of a decline to 2.5%.  The Oct job-to-applicant ratio unexpectedly eased to 1.18, weaker than expectations of no change at 1.20.\n",
      "The markets are discounting a 58% chance of a BOJ rate hike at the next policy meeting on December 19.\n",
      "December COMEX gold (GCZ25) today is up +28.00 (+0.67%), and December COMEX silver (SIZ25) is up +2.199 (+4.16%).\n",
      "Gold and silver prices are moving higher today, with gold posting a 2-week high and nearest-futures silver (Z25) up sharply at a new all-time high of $55.20 a troy ounce.\n",
      "Expectations that the Fed will cut interest rates at next month's FOMC meeting sent the 10-year T-note yield to a 1-month low today and boosted demand for precious metals as a store of value.  Trading activity in metals markets is subdued today after a technical outage at the Chicago Mercantile Exchange disrupted trading, including gold and silver futures and options on the Comex.\n",
      "Demand for precious metals as a store of value has also increased after Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that Kevin Hassett is leading the field as the potential next US Fed Chair to replace Jerome Powell.  Hassett is seen as a dovish, pro-liquidity candidate, and his nomination would question the Fed's independence, as Hassett supports President Trump's approach to cutting interest rates at the Fed, which Trump has long sought to control.\n",
      "Also, recent dovish Fed comments have increased the likelihood of a rate cut at next month's FOMC meeting to 84% and boosted demand for precious metals as a store of value. In addition, precious metals have underlying safe-haven demand amid uncertainty over US tariffs, geopolitical risks, and central bank buying.\n",
      "Concerns over tightness in Chinese silver supplies are a bullish factor for silver prices.  Silver inventories in warehouses linked to the Shanghai Futures Exchange have fallen to the lowest level in 10 years.\n",
      "On the negative side of precious metals is today's rally in stocks, which reduced safe-haven demand for precious metals.  Also, improving prospects for an end to the war in Ukraine have curbed safe-haven demand for precious metals.\n",
      "Strong central bank demand for gold is supportive of prices, following the most recent news that showed bullion held in China's PBOC reserves rose to 74.09 million troy ounces in October, the twelfth consecutive month the PBOC has boosted its gold reserves.  Also, the World Gold Council recently reported that global central banks purchased 220 MT of gold in Q3, up 28% from Q2.\n",
      "Since posting record highs in mid-October, long liquidation pressures have weighed on precious metals prices.  Holdings in gold and silver ETFs have recently fallen after posting 3-year highs on October 21.\n",
