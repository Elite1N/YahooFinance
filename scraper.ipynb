      "Black Friday is dying. Here’s what’s killing it in 2025\n",

      "Brian O'Connell\n",
      "Fri, November 28, 2025 at 5:00 PM GMT+7\n",
      "There’s a good case to be made that Black Friday, as a holiday retail powerhouse, is losing its luster. While not dead yet, the day is showing major signs of wear and tear.\n",
      "In 2025, only 20% of consumers plan to start their holiday shopping on Black Friday weekend, with 59% starting earlier and 22% shopping after or at the last minute, according to cross-channel marketing platform Cordial.\n",
      "\"Black Friday’s dominance has waned,” said Rob Garf, head of strategy and insights at Cordial. Retailers hoping for an early surge are often caught in a game of “discount chicken, waiting for consumers to act as consumers wait for deeper price cuts. The data tells us the 'Black Friday blitz' strategy is misaligned with how most consumers shop today.”\n",
      "Multiple factors have brought Black Friday to its knees in 2025. Here’s a snapshot.\n",
      "According to global clickstream data provider Datos, AI-driven discovery is rising fast. “The share of visits coming from AI chat platforms nearly doubled year-over-year (from 1–4% in 2024 to 5–8% in 2025),” the company said in a new report. “Over 55% of AI-generated prompts leading to Amazon contained purchase intent, showing that predictive, conversational search is already influencing purchase decisions.”\n",
      "Retail experts say dynamic pricing and early “soft launch” discounts now replace one-day blowouts.\n",
      "“The prevalence of e-commerce has made deals and discounts more accessible and routine, causing marquee events like Black Friday to weaken,” said Greg Zakowicz, a retail analyst at Omnisend. “Because shoppers no longer have to wait for a singular day to take advantage of sales, their purchasing has become spread throughout the season.”\n",
      "Some retailers may view this as a negative, but Zakowicz sees the glass as half full. “One benefit is that because purchases are spread out, consumers have a greater likelihood of exceeding their gift budget,” he noted.\n",
      "The rise of e-commerce and logistics automation has also accelerated the decline of the traditional doorbuster era.\n",
      "“With warehouse automation and smart routing, retailers can meet massive online demand without the in-store rush,” said Sudip Mazumder, retail industry lead at Publicis Sapient, a technology and digital information company. “Physical stores have become fulfillment hubs rather than battlegrounds for bargain hunters, reflecting a broader transformation of retail from store-centered hype to data-driven precision.”\n",
      "Retailers have also reengineered their Black Friday playbook, trading volume-driven promotions for supply-chain-led profitability,” Mazumder noted. “AI now drives discounting, clearing inventory with minimal markdowns and maximizing margins,” he said. “Success is no longer about foot traffic but about how efficiently retailers manage fulfillment and inventory.”\n",
      "By smoothing demand and optimizing logistics, retailers “are avoiding costly last-minute shipping crunches and sustaining profits across a longer holiday season,” Mazumder added.\n",
      "Retailers have figured out that pouring resources into a single shopping day pales in comparison to offering regular customer discounts and deals.\n",
      "“More and more brands are picking their own sales windows and building rituals around membership,” said Charlie Casey, CEO and co-founder of LoyaltyLion, an e-commerce customer loyalty and engagement company.\n",
      "For example, Casey cited skincare services company Inkey List, which runs “Insiders Week” with member-only pricing, double points, scratch cards, and tiered freebies. “That week delivered loyalty’s highest weekly contribution to revenue at 41%, with members spending three-times more and program sign-ups more than doubling,” Casey said. “It’s Amazon-Prime logic applied to your own calendar, away from the Black Friday and Cyber Monday dogfight.”\n",
      "Casey said he’s also seeing members-only bundles and rolling perks that hit monthly. “The effect is the same as a perpetual 'Cyber Month,' but curated for your base rather than a one-day stampede,” he noted. “When paired with zero-party data, this can be personalized so it feels special.”\n",
      "By and large, the global retail sector is moving toward a continuous commerce model rather than banner shopping days.\n",
      "“Instead of one major sales day, shoppers see a steady flow of personalized offers, loyalty rewards, and smaller, data-driven promotions throughout the season,” said Bess Devenow, senior manager of strategic communications and insights at Vantage. “While consumers may be more discerning while shopping this year, the holidays will remain a resilient retail ritual, one of the few times when emotion, tradition, and commerce intersect in a way that defines consumer behavior year after year.”\n",
      "Devenow said that Black Friday can still exist as a helpful reminder on when and how to get deals and streamline the gift-buying process, but not as a singular, one-day event.\n",
      "“This holiday season will favor retailers who make shopping feel seamless, personalized, and genuinely helpful from October through late December,” she said. “The excitement may have shifted, but the spirit of value hunting for consumers is still very much alive.”\n",
      "Other retail experts say the traditional version of Black Friday, defined by one-day doorbusters and crowded stores, has largely run its course.\n",
      "“It no longer fits how consumers shop,” said Ben Hussey, co-CEO at Katana Cloud Inventory, a business processes software company. “However, the event itself remains relevant in a new form. Black Friday continues to be one of the season’s highest-selling periods, but now functions as part of a longer, digitally driven cycle.”\n",
      "Retailers are still planning for the late-November surge, but the strategy has changed. “Now, the emphasis has shifted toward dynamic pricing, online convenience, and maintaining profitability through smarter supply chain management,” Hussey noted.\n",

      "Fri, November 28, 2025 at 4:47 PM GMT+7\n",
      "(Bloomberg) -- Top Chinese diplomat Wang Yi used a call with the French president’s diplomatic adviser to say the two sides needed to support each other, underscoring Beijing’s push to win diplomatic backing during a spat with Japan.\n",
      "Wang said in the exchange Thursday with Emmanuel Bonne that Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi had “made provocative remarks related to Taiwan” this month.\n",

      "DC Mayor Bowser Won’t Seek Reelection in 2026\n",
      "Beijing and Paris should “firmly support each other on issues involving each other’s core interests,” Wang said, according to a statement from the Foreign Ministry in Beijing. “I hope that the French side will continue to firmly abide by the One China principle.”\n",
      "French President Emmanuel Macron is due to make a state visit to China next week, and hold discussions on economic and commercial matters.\n",
      "An official at Macron’s Elysee Palace said Thursday that Paris is consistent in supporting the One China policy — the recognition that the mainland and Taiwan make up a single nation governed by Beijing — and calls for the status quo to be respected.\n",
      "In light of the Japanese prime minister’s statements, France is urging everyone to adhere to this position, since it guarantees stability and ensures there’s no escalation around Taiwan.\n",
      "That also requires China to refrain from escalating the situation following Takaichi’s remarks, said the person, who asked not to be named discussing internal deliberations. France calls for tensions to be eased and for a return to a consensual approach that respects the status quo.\n",
      "Japan’s chief cabinet secretary, Minoru Kihara, declined to comment on Wang’s outreach to France at a regular press conference on Friday afternoon. “We will continue to explain and communicate Japan’s views through various opportunities,” he said.\n",
      "Beijing kept up pressure on Takaichi, with a commentary in the Chinese Communist Party’s flagship newspaper saying Japan has yet to show remorse and still refused to retract its “erroneous” remarks. The People’s Daily article on Friday said the prime minister’s comments amounted to a serious provocation to China’s sovereignty.\n",
      "China has tried to rally diplomatic support during its dispute with Japan by sending a letter to United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres last week accusing Takaichi of violating international law with comments that publicly linked a Taiwan Strait crisis with the possible deployment of Japanese troops.\n",
      "The diplomatic push comes on top of other moves China has taken against Japan, such as economic reprisals and ramped up rhetoric.\n",
      "Takaichi spoke with Macron on Nov. 23 to reaffirm their partnership. The two countries have been working on a reciprocal access agreement to facilitate joint training between their militaries, according to Japan’s Foreign Ministry.\n",
      "As fellow members of the Group of Seven leading democracies, the two have shown unity in opposing any unilateral attempts by the likes of Beijing to change the status quo in the Taiwan Strait by force or coercion.\n",
      "Takaichi has refused China’s demand to retract the remarks she made on Nov. 7 that linked Japan’s security to a Taiwan contingency, the first such instance for a sitting prime minister.\n",
      "This week, Takaichi said she didn’t intend to get specific on Taiwan and reiterated the government’s position on responding to regional contingencies — namely, that for any incident, Japan would make a judgment taking into account all relevant information.\n",

      "(Bloomberg) -- Trading of futures and options on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange was halted by a data-center fault, causing hours of disruption to markets across equities, foreign exchange, bonds and commodities.\n",
      "The malfunction is already longer than a similar, hours-long outage due to a technical error back in 2019 and underscores the reach of CME Group and its Globex electronic trading platform. It triggered widespread frustration as market participants contemplated the prospect of a lost trading session.\n",

      "“It’s a bit like flying dark,” said Thomas Helaine, head of equity sales at TP ICAP Europe in Paris. “When you’re trading cash equity like us, US futures give you an indication of where the market is going before the open. I can only imagine how complicated it must be for derivatives desks.”\n",
      "Millions of contracts tracking the S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq 100 trade every weekday virtually around the clock on the CME, one of the world’s largest derivatives exchanges. A spokesman for the group confirmed the outage was due to cooling issues at data centers run by CyrusOne, a Dallas-headquartered operator, but did not provide an estimated reopen time.\n",
      "The outage halted trading of US Treasury futures, while European and UK bond markets that trade on a different exchange were unaffected. EBS, a platform used in foreign exchange, was impacted, hurting price discovery in the market.\n",
      "For some traders, the timing of the disruption on Friday could cause particular inconvenience if it lasts, due to the need to roll positions from one monthly contract to another.\n",
      "Gold saw erratic moves in early London trading, with the gap between bids and offers about 20 times wider than normal. US crude oil and palm oil on the Bursa Malaysia exchange were also affected. In commodities markets, Friday is the expiry day for gasoline and diesel futures that can be settled with delivery of the actual physical fuel, adding a further potential complication.\n",
      "Angry Traders\n",
      "“Traders sitting with a position are certainly quite angry,” said Gnanasekar Thiagarajan, head of trading and hedging strategies at Kaleesuwari Intercontinental.\n",
      "Others reported that volumes had shifted onto alternative, operational platforms as liquidity and price transparency evaporated.\n",
      "“Traders will be switching to alternative liquidity tools where they can,” said Nick Twidale, chief analyst at AT Global Markets in Sydney. “We’ve lost one of the market’s major liquidity sources. This heightens the risk of exacerbated moves if a big event occurs.”\n",
      "Most US markets were closed on Thursday for the Thanksgiving holiday, and are due to reopen later for a shortened trading day. Thankfully for traders, there is limited news expected on Friday with no economic data scheduled for release in the US, and there are no expected Federal Reserve speakers ahead of a blackout period leading up to their anticipated December decision.\n",
      "November has been a volatile month for equities, with the S&P 500 slumping as much as 4.7% amid concerns about the path of Fed rate cuts and valuations about artificial intelligence-linked stocks. The index has clawed back those losses and volatility has been falling all week, back near October lows. The US stock benchmark is close to erasing its monthly drop with one more session left before the final month of the year.\n",
      "Bourses operated by CME include the Chicago Board of Trade, the New York Mercantile Exchange and the Commodity Exchange. CME also has a stake in other exchanges, including the Gulf Mercantile Exchange, which said in a notice to the market that it had also seen trade halted due to the cooling issue.\n",

      "Gross domestic product is expected to expand 3.54% in 2026, according to a statement from the statistics bureau in Taipei on Friday. That compares with the previous forecast of 2.81% back in August. Exports were projected to grow 6.32% for the year, versus an earlier call of 2.19%.\n",
      "The bureau also said the economy was expected to grow by 7.37% in 2025, compared to the previous forecast of 4.45%. The new figure would be the fastest expansion since 2010.\n",
      "“As long as companies are building the AI infrastructure, demand for Taiwan’s tech products will continue to be there,” Tsai Yu-tai, head of statistics for the Directorate-General of Budget, Accounting and Statistics, said at a briefing.\n",
      "The new estimates come as debate mounts over the business prospects for companies linked to the AI revolution. Earlier this month, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. reported its slowest monthly revenue growth in more than a year. The main chipmaker to AI leader Nvidia Corp. posted a 16.9% rise in sales for October, which did roughly track with the average analyst estimate.\n",
      "Taiwan’s economy has benefited from roaring exports this year. In October, outbound shipments surged at the fastest pace since 2010, largely due to massive demand for the chips and servers powering AI. Shipments to the US skyrocketed 144.3% to a record — underscoring Taiwan’s key role in the tech supply chain as companies like Meta Platforms Inc. and OpenAI race to build AI infrastructure.\n",
      "The statistics bureau also said GDP was expected to grow by 8.21% in the third quarter, versus its earlier estimate of 7.64%.\n",
      "Bumki Son, economist at Barclays Bank Plc, described this forecast as “another big upside surprise.”\n",
      "“This likely makes Taiwan the fastest growing economy in EM Asia in our coverage universe” for 2025, Son added.\n",
      "Roaring tech exports have eased worries about US President Donald Trump’s trade war. Many analysts had worried that tariffs would hit Taiwan’s economy, especially in the second half of 2025 but since many tech goods have mostly been exempted from the duties, that hasn’t come to pass.\n",
      "The Trump administration hit Taiwan with a 20% tariff rate on July 31 — a level that is higher than what the US has levied on South Korea and Japan. Officials in Taiwan have indicated they are trying to clinch a better deal with Washington but that has proven elusive so far.\n",

      "JP Morgan Asset Management’s Iain Stealey said the sales had created a bit of “a shock and some temporary indigestion,” and he reckons investment-grade spreads are about 10 basis points wider as a result. But he told the conference on Thursday that broader fears were overdone.\n",
      "“Yes, there has been a lot of issuance, but these are enormous companies producing significant earnings every year,” said Stealey, who is chief investment officer of international fixed income at the asset manager. “It’s not yet at a point where we should be overly concerned. In fact, some of the concessions offered on recent deals make them quite compelling opportunities, especially given the very high quality of the issuers involved.”\n",
      "Stealey believes future supply should be more evenly spaced. Meta has already indicated it likely won’t issue again until the second half of next year, he said.\n",
      "In addition, the fact that the big tech companies have very little debt means that they are attractive as credit, said Mahesh Bhimalingam, global head of credit strategy at Bloomberg Intelligence. He pointed out Alphabet has a better credit rating than France, while other firms such as Apple Inc. and Microsoft Corp. would also stand out among higher-rated names if tapping the market in Europe.\n",
      "“So when they do come in, I think there’s going to be a massive bid,” he said.\n",
      "Credit Positive\n",
      "Speakers at the conference struck an upbeat tone on credit overall, arguing that carry and healthy balance sheets would be supportive in 2026.\n",
      "“Yields remain very attractive, which makes moving up in quality a sensible strategy,” said Ashwin Palta, global high-yield portfolio manager at BNY Investments Newton. “You’re being paid appropriately for that level of risk, whereas lower-quality names aren’t offering enough spread pickup to justify reaching down the credit curve.”\n",
      "He added that in terms of subordination, Additional Tier 1, Restricted Tier 1 and hybrids looked appealing, particularly compared with Double B high yield.\n",
      "AT1 bonds have been one of the strongest performers this year so far, with returns topping 10% year-to-date, and speakers at a later panel on this subject said they expect this to continue in 2026.\n",
      "“Probably we are at peak asset quality, but we start from a relatively good position, so I probably would say ‘more of the same’,” said Filippo Maria Alloatti, head of financials credit at Federated Hermes.\n",
      "The best upside in this space is in the smaller banks issuing bonds, according to Jackie Ineke, chief investment officer of Spring Investments.\n",
      "She said, for example, that Metro Bank Holdings Plc’s AT1 bonds carry less risk than many larger lenders. The British challenger bank has seen its shares and bonds recover sharply after it emerged it would be a beneficiary of Chancellor Rachel Reeves’ deregulation push across the City of London. It was also recently upgraded by Fitch Ratings after it returned to profitability in the first half of 2025.\n",
      "Ineke said there’s more risk associated with some larger investment banks than with Metro Bank after “where it’s been and where it’s going.”\n",

      "Car production at UK factories plunged by a quarter last month despite Jaguar Land Rover (JLR) restarting production after its devastating cyber attack.\n",
      "The number of cars rolling off the production line in October fell almost 24pc to 59,010 compared to the same month last year, figures from the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) showed on Friday.\n",
      "Total vehicle production, which includes vans and trucks, plunged 31pc year on year to 62,116. This is the lowest number for the month of October since 1956, when 51,680 units were produced.\n",
      "The figures coincide with JLR, the country’s largest automotive employer, gradually restarting production after its plants came to a halt following the weeks-long outage.\n",
      "JLR, owned by Indian giant Tata, was forced to stop all UK vehicle production at the beginning of September and was unable to resume global operations until five weeks later.\n",
      "It made a phased restart of some manufacturing operations on Oct 8, but this was not enough stop the overall output decline across the car market, SMMT said.\n",
      "Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive said October was “another difficult month for UK vehicle production as the impact of the earlier cyber attack continued to be felt”.\n",

      "Bullion was near $4,160 an ounce on Friday, up more than 2% for the week. A series of comments by Federal Reserve officials and the release of delayed economic data have supported the case for lower borrowing costs, which typically benefit gold as it doesn’t pay interest. Swap traders are pricing in a more-than-80% chance of a quarter-point cut in December.\n",
      "Traders will be digesting every last clue for the next rate decision before the US central bank goes into an external communication blackout starting Saturday. A record-setting government shutdown has delayed key data, and some statistics will not be released at all, making it challenging for the Fed and investors to assess the state of the world’s largest economy.\n",
      "Bullion has gained nearly every month this year, and is on track for its best annual performance since 1979. Elevated central-bank buying as well as robust non-sovereign inflows to exchange-traded funds supported the metal’s run to a record above $4,380 last month. Investors have piled into alternative assets in a wider retreat from government bonds and currencies.\n",

      "Fri, November 28, 2025 at 3:36 PM GMT+7\n",
      "For proof that an economy can thrive even under constant military threats from a powerful neighbor and amid US President Donald Trump’s sweeping global tariffs, look no further than Taiwan.\n",
      "The self-ruled democracy has logged roughly 8% economic growth for two consecutive quarters, a rare achievement for a developed economy and one that is projected to push its 2025 GDP growth close to 7.4%, even surpassing China’s.\n",
      "“Taiwan’s economy has clearly been one of the best performing economies in the world, particularly over recent quarters,” said Jason Tuvey, an economist at Capital Economics. “Many people expected Taiwan’s economy to benefit from the sort of AI boom, but maybe many underestimated to what extent it would do.”\n",
      "Taiwan’s statistics bureau on Friday reported 8.21% year-on-year growth in GDP in the third quarter, driven by a 36.5% surge in exports in the period ending September. This followed an already striking 7.7% expansion in the second quarter.\n",
      "In October, exports hit a record high, climbing 49.7% from a year earlier – the largest single month increase in over 15 years.\n",
      "To top it all off, Taiwan’s stock market overtook Germany’s in September as the world’s eighth largest, riding on the global frenzy for artificial intelligence.\n",
      "But even as Taiwan’s economy flourishes, driven by the outsized influence of its high-tech sector as exemplified by the world-beating chipmaker TSMC, many citizens have been unable to share in the boom, as income gaps widen and wages remain stagnant.\n",
      "Economists say a key reason is that the gains are highly concentrated. Electronics manufacturing accounts for more than 15% of GDP but employs just 6.5% of the workforce, according to Capital Economics.\n",
      "This unevenness is partly reflected in sluggish consumer spending. Consumer confidence has remained subdued throughout the year, according to the index released by the Research Center of Taiwan Economic Development. Trump’s trade war has also dampened sentiment, economists say, particularly as Taiwan has yet to finalize a trade agreement with Washington.\n",
      "“From my perspective as a salaried worker earning above the median income, I feel the economy isn’t actually doing that well,” said Vivian Chen, a nurse in the Southern port city of Kaohsiung.\n",
      "Chen’s observations are echoed by many in the home of the global chip powerhouse. Taiwan’s GDP per capita is forecast to exceed $38,000 this year, outpacing South Korea and Japan. But its average wage lags both countries by at least 30%, according to CNN’s calculations of official data.\n",
      "Taiwan’s tech prowess, built over decades in the chip and electronics industries, has positioned the island to benefit from the AI boom. As tech giants from Google and OpenAI to Microsoft rush to build data centers powered by graphics processing units designed by Nvidia and AMD, Taiwanese companies have been at the forefront, manufacturing the semiconductors and servers essential for training AI models.\n",
      "In one prominent example, TSMC, the world’s largest contract chipmaker that supplies Nvidia and is known by locals as the “protector of the nation,” has raised its full-year revenue growth forecast to the mid-30% range, driven by the explosive growth in AI, after surpassing sales expectations in previous quarters.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Taiwan’s outbound shipments to the US, where most of the AI data center expansions have occurred, have grown more than 63% in the first 10 months of this year, according to Taiwan’s Ministry of Finance.\n",
      "But questions have mounted about the sustainability of this export-driven boom, especially amid concerns that the AI frenzy could cool.\n",
      "Taiwan’s export growth “will definitely come down next year,” said Wang Jiann-Chyuan, vice president of the semi-official thinktank Chung-Hua Institution for Economic Research. He expects growth to retreat from about 30% in recent quarters to single digits, as this year’s surge makes further expansion harder.\n",
      "Adding to the uncertainty is Trump, Wang said. Taiwan’s trade surplus with the US hit a record this year, raising the risk of scrutiny from a president who has made reducing trade deficits a central goal of his tariff campaign.\n",
      "So far, chips and electronics, which made up more than 73% of Taiwan’s exports, have been spared from the levy. While Trump has repeatedly threatened triple-digit tariffs on semiconductors, he has exempted companies, including TSMC, that build manufacturing facilities in the United States.\n",
      "Still, the heavy concentration of exports in the high-tech sector has amplified concerns about over-reliance on a single industry — or even a single company. While chips and electronics now account for nearly three-quarters of exports, up from roughly half five years ago, traditional sectors such as metals, machinery, and plastics have seen little growth or outright decline.\n",
      "For Wu Jieh-min, a researcher at Taiwan’s top research institute Academia Sinica, however, part of the concern about the island’s economic future are associated with many Taiwanese people’s deep-seated insecurity about its political status. China claims Taiwan as part of its territory, despite having never controlled it, and has vowed to absorb it by force, if necessary.\n",
      "“I think the cautious, on-edge mindset you see across Taiwanese society is very obvious, and I actually see it as something positive,” said Wu, whose research focuses on political economy and sociology.\n",
      "“We have to manage our own future very carefully, because even just surviving is already difficult for us,” he said.\n",
      "On the ground, some Taiwanese say the rosy headline figures don’t reflect their daily lives, like Chen, the nurse, who said salaries for health professionals feel stagnant.\n",
      "“That’s why you hear doctors complaining about being underpaid, and why so many nurses are leaving the country or the industry altogether,” Chen said.\n",
      "“People in Taiwan keep hyping themselves up, saying things like ‘We have TSMC,’ or boasting about how high the stock market is. But for many living here, their monthly pay stayed much the same,” she added.\n",
      "GT Lin, an AI engineer in Taipei, echoed that sentiment.\n",
      "“That’s why I’ve come to the conclusion that the country is strong, but the people aren’t necessarily wealthy,” he said.\n",
      "Taiwan’s real wage growth, adjusted for inflation, began to slow in the late 1990s and has remained stagnant since the early 2000s. Labor’s share of GDP peaked at about 50% in the 1990s and has since fallen to around 44%.\n",
      "Roy Ngerng, a Singaporean labor activist based in Taipei who has written extensively about the issue of wage stagnation in Taiwan, attributed the problem to long-term wage suppression — aimed at boosting export competitiveness.\n",
      "He said that while Taiwan’s economy has seen exceptional growth in recent years – and booming profits among tech businesses – average workers and employees in other sectors have been mostly left out, widening the income disparity.\n",
      "Just five years ago, wages in the electronics sector were already 35% above the economy-wide average, according to Capital Economics. Now they are more than 70% higher.\n",
      "Ngerng added that the current government has been steadily increasing the minimum wage.\n",
      "Wu Tsong-Min, an economist at National Taiwan University, however, notes that wage stagnation is “not unique to Taiwan,” as many advanced economies face similar issues, particularly among low-skill workers.\n",
      "Wu, the author of “A 400-Year History of Taiwan’s Economy,” also pointed out that Taiwan’s GDP per capita, after adjusted for purchasing power, rises further thanks to lower domestic prices.\n",
      "Still, housing remains a major burden: Taipei’s house price-to-income ratio has nearly tripled in the past two decades, surpassing London, New York and even Hong Kong, according to the Global Property Guide.\n",
      "For Wu of Academia Sinica, he remains optimistic, saying that the thriving tech industry could generate spillover effects that trickle down to other sectors.\n",
      "“Taiwan’s economy wasn’t shaped by deliberate planning or an exceptionally capable government, but rather an evolutionary process,” he said.\n",
      "While the size of Taiwan’s economy is dwarfed by leading global powers, Wu added, its small and medium-sized enterprises are nimble, adaptable and attuned to global trends.\n",
      "“That’s how its semiconductor industry became what it is today.”\n",

      "Boosted by a wave of analyst optimism and a wider equities rally, Siemens Energy AG shares are up by 13% this week and hovering near an all-time high, fully recouping last Friday’s 10% slump. That’s pushed the company’s market value to within touching distance of €100 billion ($116 billion).\n",
      "“Global electricity demand is rising, especially in markets Siemens Energy is in,” said Nikolas Demeter, an analyst at B Metzler Seel Sohn & Co AG, who upgraded the shares to buy on Monday. He added that the stock remains appealing due to an attractive valuation and the firm’s strong order backlog.\n",
      "The German company, spun off from industrial giant Siemens AG in 2020, was Europe’s best-performing stock in 2024, surging 320% on booming demand for data centers, a vital part of AI infrastructure. It’s climbed another 127% so far this year, and the upward momentum is expected to continue.\n",
      "More than a fifth of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg have raised their price targets on the renewable energy company since it announced plans last week to buy back up to €6 billion of its own shares. The stock tumbled the following day as short-term investors took profits, amid broader market concerns as to whether heavy AI spending is delivering returns.\n",
      "Brokers have stayed upbeat. Berenberg analysts led by Richard Dawson were among those who raised their price targets, saying that while the broader data-center theme might cause share price volatility, earnings growth forecasts and the shareholder return framework means they “remain positive.”\n",
      "Earlier in November, Siemens Energy substantially lifted its mid-term financial targets on strong demand for gas turbines and data-center equipment as well as restructuring progress at its troubled Gamesa wind turbine unit.\n",
      "The firm is “building tomorrow’s energy infrastructure,” said Deutsche Bank AG analysts led by Gael de-Bray, who also raised their targets this week.\n",
      "In a show of durability, Siemens Energy is currently 2025’s best performer in a UBS basket of European AI stocks, set to extend its winning streak to a second year. It has shown resilience to the concerns that trouble other AI names.\n",
      "“In recent months, the correlation between AI stocks and Siemens Energy has been relatively high. Looking at this week, however, the picture has shifted somewhat,” Demeter said. “Siemens Energy has performed significantly better than Nvidia.”\n",

      "Early enterprise customers struggled to translate that excitement into usable systems. Jarvis said the only consistently successful approach was to embed directly with clients, learn their workflows, and work alongside their staff. This led OpenAI to set up a forward-deployed model.\n",
      "One of the team's major projects was with Morgan Stanley, which became one of OpenAI's first enterprise customers to deploy GPT-4.\n",
      "The technical scaffolding took six to eight weeks, but convincing financial advisors to trust the tech took far longer, Jarvis said. The team had to spend another four months running pilots, collecting evaluations, and iterating with wealth advisors.\n",
      "\"In the end, about 98% of them adopted it,\" he said.\n",
      "The team also worked with a semiconductor company in Europe to build a \"debug investigation and triage agent\" that could examine failures and fix bugs. They looked across the company's value chain and realized engineers were spending 70% to 80% of their time debugging chips, Jarvis said.\n",
      "Jarvis said that forward-deployed engineering teams have to be clear about their purpose. His team avoids \"services revenue\" and is focused on creating product playbooks, he added.\n",
      "Earlier this year, Jarvis announced in a LinkedIn post that he would be leading OpenAI's new forward-deployed engineering function.\n",
      "\"Our focus is getting our customers to production, whether it's through a zero-to-one novel application of our tech or helping you to scale proven cases,\" he wrote in January.\n",
      "Since then, OpenAI has been hiring forward-deployed engineers around the world, including San Francisco, New York, Dublin, London, Paris, Munich, and Singapore.\n",
      "In July, OpenAI's international managing director, Oliver Jay, said that the forward-deployed engineering model is a \"really specific way to advance the acceleration of advanced AI into scale production cases.\"\n",
      "\"This is where we solve the latest gap between companies,\" Jay said in Singapore at the Fortune Brainstorm AI 2025 conference.\n",
      "Venture investors have also noticed the value the model delivers.\n",
      "YC partner Diana Hu said in an episode of the \"Y Combinator\" podcast published in June that she and her team have seen founders close \"six, seven-figure deals\" with major companies by being forward-deployed engineers.\n",

      "House prices in the South of England have fallen for the first time since Labour took power as the Budget hits the property market.\n",
      "Prices fell year-on-year in November across London, the South East and the South West of England, according to Zoopla. It marks the first fall across this region in 18 months.\n",
      "Prospective homebuyers have been spooked for several weeks by rumours that the Chancellor’s Budget would introduce more taxes for homes worth more than £500,000.\n",
      "In the event, Rachel Reeves opted for a narrower tax on properties worth £2m or more. However, the speculation in the run-up to Wednesday’s statement proved damaging to areas of the country where property prices are highest.\n",
      "Prices in London and the South East edged down by 0.1pc in the four weeks to Nov 23, while those in the South West of England declined by 0.2pc.\n",
      "Buyer interest slumped by 12pc decline in buyer demand across Britain during the four-week period, researchers said. Fewer house sales were agreed, with the number falling by 4pc year-on-year.\n",
      "Richard Donnell, the executive director at Zoopla, said: “Home buyers and sellers will welcome the end of the uncertainty that has stalled housing market activity since the late summer.\n",
      "“With greater certainty, we expect a rebound in housing market activity that builds into the new year, with households who paused home moving decisions over recent months returning with greater confidence.\n",
      "“The removal of the threat of a new annual property tax from 210,000 homes [worth over £500,000] is particularly positive for the market and will help revive activity in higher-value areas across southern England where house prices are under pressure.”\n",
      "House prices were more resilient beyond the South of England, with the average across the UK climbing by 1.3pc year-on-year to £270,200.\n",
      "The South is expected to bear the brunt of the Chancellor’s new tax surcharge on homes worth more than £2m set to take effect in April 2028.\n",
      "Owners of affected homes will need to pay an annual council tax surcharge on top of their usual council tax payments.\n",
      "This surcharge will apply to four price bands, starting from £2,500 a year for homes valued between £2m to 2.5m, rising to £7,500 per year for those in the top band of £5m and above.\n",

      "It is expected to hit more than 140,000 homes, disproportionately affecting homeowners in London and the South East, where 82pc of recent sales of homes worth more than £2m were.\n",
      "David Powell, the chief executive of Andrews, an estate agency, said: “There will be much disappointment around the £2m-plus mansion tax and it’s likely the South will get hit the hardest.”\n",
      "However, Tom Bill, the head of UK residential research at Knight Frank, added: “There are still questions around the mansion tax. Until it is introduced in 2028, buyers and sellers face uncertainty around price thresholds and even once valuations are completed, they could be challenged, which would prolong the limbo.”\n",

      "The stock rose for a fifth-straight day Friday in Taipei, taking its weekly gain to 22%, on investor enthusiasm over Google’s latest Gemini model and AI chip deals. MediaTek has reportedly partnered with the Alphabet Inc. unit on design of tensor processing units, seen as a potential rival to Nvidia Corp. chips in AI applications.\n",

      "Known for its smartphone chips, MediaTek has suffered from a cloudy outlook for end-product demand as well as margin pressure due to competition and high development costs. The AI news has brought relief for the shares, which are still down 1% on the year.\n",
      "China business remains tough into 2026, yet “Google TPU upside should offset the smartphone headwind in the longer term,” according to Morgan Stanley analysts Charlie Chan and Daniel Yen. They upgraded the stock to overweight from equal-weight on Thursday.\n",
      "The early days of AI centered on training of large language models, which requires the massive computing power provided by graphic processing units such as those from Nvidia. The shift in focus to inference — or how LLMs respond to user queries — is putting a spotlight on application-specific integrated circuits such as TPUs.\n",
      "UBS Group AG analysts led by Sunny Lin raised their estimate for MediaTek’s sales contribution from TPUs in 2027 to $4 billion from $1.8 billion. The analysts see the chips accounting for 20% of the company’s operating profit by 2028, “depending on execution by MediaTek and Google,” they wrote in a note dated Thursday.\n",
      "Part of this week’s excitement was due to news that Meta Platforms Inc. is in discussions to use Google TPUs in data centers in 2027. UBS sees further potential upside for MediaTek from additional ASIC projects with Meta.\n",
      "The sell-side overall is bullish on MediaTek, with 23 buy recommendations, 10 holds and no sells. The consensus price target projects a further 9% rise in the stock over the next year.\n",
      "In terms of future AI stock investing, Macquarie Group Ltd. analysts including Arthur Lai say they “lean more” toward MediaTek and other Google partners over the Nvidia supply chain.\n",
      "“We view the current AI surge as less a speculative bubble but rather a necessary, capital-intensive build-out of a new, foundational technology layer,” they wrote in a report this week.\n",

      "Crude oil and natural gas from overseas, including Russia, are important for Japan’s energy security, the country’s economy ministry told Reuters this week, noting the Sakhalin-1 oil and gas project in Russia’s Far East.\n",
      "“Japan government continues to recognize that securing energy from overseas, including the Sakhalin Project, is extremely important for Japan's energy security,” the statement said. “We will take necessary measures to ensure that Japan's stable energy supply is not compromised,” the ministry also said.\n",
      "Japan’s Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry was responding to a question by Reuters regarding the latest U.S. sanctions on Rosneft, Russia’s biggest oil producer and a shareholder in the Sakhalin-1 project, which also has the Japanese economy ministry as a shareholder. The project used to be operated by Exxon, but the supermajor left Russia in 2022.\n",
      "Rosneft has 20% in Sakhalin-1, India’s ONGC Videsh holds another 20%, and a Japanese consortium comprising the economy ministry and several energy companies holds 30%. When the sanction barrage on Russia started following its invasion of Ukraine, the Japanese companies and the ministry were granted an exemption from the punitive action due to the country’s overwhelming dependence on foreign energy commodities.\n",
      "Since then, Japanese government officials have repeatedly stated Japan would find it difficult to quit Russian energy. Besides Sakhalin-1, which exports crude oil to Japan, the country also buys liquefied natural gas from the Sakhalin-2 project. Russian LNG accounts for about 9% of Japan’s total liquefied natural gas imports. Utility JERA imports the gas from Sakhalin-2 under contracts expiring in 2026 and 2029\n",
      "Last month, following President Donald Trump’s suggestion that Japan stop buying Russian energy commodities, the government reiterated its stance, with the economy minister noting the country had been “steadily reducing its dependence on Russian energy.”\n",

      "(Bloomberg) -- President Donald Trump called for “reverse migration” in the US as he outlined a series of potential measures to crack down on immigration, including halting admissions from unspecified developing nations and revoking citizenship from some naturalized migrants.\n",
      "In a pair of Truth Social posts late Thursday that disparaged many US immigrants, Trump said he would “permanently pause migration from all Third World Countries” and “denaturalize migrants who undermine domestic tranquility.”\n",

      "He added that he would terminate millions of admissions under his predecessor Joe Biden and “remove anyone who is not a net asset to the United States, or is incapable of loving our Country.” Trump also said he would end all federal benefits for non-citizens.\n",
      "“These goals will be pursued with the aim of achieving a major reduction in illegal and disruptive populations, including those admitted through an unauthorized and illegal Autopen approval process,” Trump said, using a reference to the Biden administration. “Only REVERSE MIGRATION can fully cure this situation.”\n",
      "Trump offered no details on how he would implement these policies or what he considers a “third world” country, an ill-defined and often offensive term for developing nations. Congress for years has failed to pass major immigration reforms, and courts have blocked some of his previous executive orders limiting immigration.\n",
      "The post followed an attack Wednesday on two National Guard members in Washington by an Afghan national, an assault that Trump had used to amplify his anti-immigration policies. Earlier in the day, the president had announced the death of one of the guardsman, US Army Specialist Sarah Beckstrom, 20.\n",
      "After the shooting, the White House halted Afghan immigration proceedings and ordered a review of those already in the US. The administration had already planned to review the cases of all refugees resettled under Biden and freeze their green card applications, according to a memo reviewed by Bloomberg this month.\n",
      "The US has admitted more than 190,000 Afghans since the 2021 fall of Kabul to the Taliban, mostly those who assisted US forces and their families during the war.\n",
      "On Thursday, Joseph Edlow, the head of US Citizenship and Immigration Services, said in a social media post that his agency — under Trump’s orders — is conducting “a full scale, rigorous reexamination of every Green Card for every alien from every country of concern.”\n",
      "The White House in June announced a ban on immigration from 12 countries, including Afghanistan, Haiti, Somalia and Sudan, and restrictions on seven others. In his first term, Trump barred travelers from Cuba, Iran, Libya, North Korea, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, Venezuela and Yemen.\n",
      "Trump has also pursued aggressive immigration enforcement, deploying teams to cities over the objections of local officials and amid claims that authorities are wrongfully deporting migrants in violation of court orders and other legal protections.\n",
      "The administration has sharply reduced the refugee admissions cap, ended temporary protected status for migrants from several countries, imposed a $100,000 application fee for H-1B visas used by tech companies and universities, and revoked thousands of visas. It is also challenging the constitutional right to birthright citizenship under the 14th Amendment.\n",
      "Upon returning to office in January, Trump signed an executive order halting all refugee admissions, which was promptly challenged in court. An appeals court allowed new admissions to be paused as the litigation continues, but ordered the government to provide services to refugees who already had arrived.\n",

      "Fri, November 28, 2025 at 2:15 PM GMT+7\n",
      "BEIJING/SHANGHAI (Reuters) -China's Baidu started layoffs this week that will hit multiple business units, six sources briefed on the matter said, as the company struggles with intensifying competition in artificial intelligence and declining advertising ​revenue.\n",
      "The move by the company, which runs China's largest search engine, comes shortly after it reported a third-quarter loss ‌on November 18. The sources added that the layoffs were expected to run until the end of this year. Reuters was not able to establish the ‌companywide number of jobs being cut but the sources said it was internally perceived to be large-scale. The layoff numbers varied by business unit and performance ratings and could reach as high as 40% for some teams, two of the people said.\n",
      "AI TO BE PROTECTED\n",
      "The mobile ecosystem group will bear the brunt of the cuts, two sources said.\n",
      "However, roles tied to AI and cloud computing will largely be protected, said four of the ⁠people. One of the sources said more resources ‌would be directed to AI. The sources declined to be named as the information is private. Baidu's workforce stood at 35,900 at the end of last year, down from ‍39,800 in 2023 and 41,300 a year earlier, according to its annual reports. Baidu did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The cuts follow Baidu's second straight quarterly revenue decline; total revenue fell 7% and online advertising revenue dropped 18% in the third quarter. It ​also posted a loss of 11.23 billion yuan ($1.59 billion) for the period. Baidu ‌has spent years investing in AI, but those efforts have yet to revive growth in its core online advertising business, which has ceded market share to social media platforms like RedNote and ByteDance's Douyin. Although Baidu was the first major Chinese tech firm to roll out a ChatGPT-style service in 2023, it has struggled to maintain an early lead against competitors including Alibaba and AI start-up DeepSeek. Baidu's Ernie large language model is trailing offerings from rivals including Alibaba and DeepSeek after multiple strategy shifts, ⁠including a move to open source it earlier this year. ​Adoption has also lagged. In September, Baidu's Ernie Bot app had 10.​77 million monthly active users, lower than 150 million for ByteDance's Doubao and 73.4 million for DeepSeek, according to AI product tracker Aicpb.com. Baidu has focused its AI push on embedding the technology ‍into existing products, including search,⁠ and says more than half of its mobile search result pages now include AI-generated content. Job reductions have become a common tool for major Chinese internet companies seeking to cut costs in a highly competitive sector. Alibaba ⁠and Tencent slashed tens of thousands of jobs in 2022 to cope with a broad regulatory crackdown on China's major internet platforms. In addition, ‌several tech companies in the U.S. like Amazon and IBM are cutting thousands of jobs globally.\n",

      "Fri, November 28, 2025 at 2:00 PM GMT+7\n",
      "Gravis Robotics, a Zurich-based startup that is turning heavyweight construction machines into autonomous robots, has raised $23 million to expand its operations in the U.K., U.S., and EU. The funding was led by IQ Capital and Zacua Ventures, with participation from Pear VC, Imad, Sunna Ventures, Armada Investment, and Holcim. Gravis plans to use the funds to build more machines and expand partnerships with construction firms.\n",
      "Founded in 2022, Gravis is trying to solve one of the construction industry’s key problems—a looming talent shortage. A large proportion of skilled machine operators are nearing retirement, and not enough younger workers are entering the field to replace them, co-founder and CEO Ryan Luke Johns told Fortune.\n",
      "“There’s a massive peak in demand for renewable, resilient infrastructure, which means we need more operators—and there just isn’t enough,” he said. “It’s not a sexy job. It’s not a job that any young person really wants to go into.”\n",
      "Across the U.K., Europe, and the U.S., governments are building wind farms and grid infrastructure to meet clean‑energy goals, tech companies are rushing to construct huge data centers to power AI, and cities desperately need more housing. The talent shortage threatens to slow all of this, potentially driving up costs and stretching timelines on projects that power everything from renewable energy to the servers running ChatGPT.\n",
      "The autonomous construction equipment market is in demand, partly driven by this surge in infrastructure development projects. The industry was valued at $8.8 billion in 2023 and is expected to grow at over 7.5% annually through 2032, according to Global Market Insights.\n",
      "Part of the reason construction work is becoming increasingly unattractive for humans is that operators face a high risk of injury. Johns told Fortune that Gravis’ technology aims to address such concerns by reducing risky tasks, like surveying or marking out work areas, while keeping humans in control. The company adds cameras, sensors, and AI to existing excavators, loaders, and other heavy machines so they can operate autonomously or with remote guidance via Gravis’ Slate tablet.\n",
      "“Our technology is actually bringing other young people to want to do this job,” he added. “Because you’re looking at a tablet, instead of sitting behind joysticks.”\n",
      "Gravis’ machines are already in use in seven countries across four continents, including Europe, the U.S., Latin America, and Asia. The company has worked with clients including Holcim, Taylor Woodrow, and HD Hyundai. In the U.K., Gravis has been conducting trials of autonomous excavation with Taylor Woodrow at Manchester Airport.\n",
      "“The fastest path to autonomy is delivering productivity today,” Johns said. “By giving operators real-time 3D intelligence and the ability to shift seamlessly between autonomy and guided control, we cover more of the work, accelerate adoption, and create the data pipeline needed to learn new capabilities from the industry’s hardest jobs.”\n",
      "Johns says Gravis is not aiming for fully unmanned construction sites. Instead, its systems work alongside humans, learning from complex and changing sites while boosting productivity. As demand grows for housing, renewable energy projects, and safer infrastructure, Gravis believes its AI and sensors can help contractors get more work done efficiently and safely.\n",
      "“Gravis stands out, not just for its technical brilliance, but for how much it’s already achieved. The team’s thoughtful, grounded approach to autonomy—deploying real systems with real crews—has led to trusted partnerships with some of the largest global construction companies and [original equipment manufacturers] and invaluable data from time-in-field,” said Archie Muirhead, partner at IQ Capital. “This huge and unserved market is ready now for autonomy.”\n",
      "The company is entering a competitive market dominated by equipment giants like Caterpillar, Komatsu, and Volvo Group, and startups including San Francisco-based Built Robotics, which has raised over $100 million since 2016. Industry adoption also faces a few barriers, including high upfront costs that smaller contractors struggle to justify and regulatory fragmentation across jurisdictions.\n",

      "Federal authorities have identified the suspected shooter as Rahmanullah Lakanwal, 29, an Afghan national who previously worked with US forces and the CIA in Afghanistan before arriving in the US in 2021. He was subdued shortly after the shooting and taken into custody. Trump said he is in serious condition.\n",
      "Attorney General Pam Bondi said Thursday that she would seek the death penalty for Lakanwal if either of the shooting victims died. Federal authorities have launched a sprawling, nationwide terrorism investigation into this attack that included searches in Washington state and California.\n",
      "Beckstrom began her military service in June 2023. She and Wolfe had been in Washington since the beginning of the National Guard deployment in the US capital in August.\n",
      "Jeanine Pirro, the US attorney for DC, said at a news conference earlier Thursday that the suspect is currently facing three charges of intent to kill while armed.\n",
      "Trump, Vice President JD Vance and others in the administration quickly blamed the Biden administration for letting Lakanwal into the US and seized on the case to push for deeper immigration curbs.\n",

      "Trump on Thursday criticized the Biden administration over its handling of evacuation flights that included Afghan asylum seekers as US forces withdrew from Afghanistan in 2021.\n",
      "“When it comes to asylum, when they’re flown in, it’s very hard to get them out,” Trump told reporters at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. “No matter how you want to do it, it’s very hard to get them out but we’re going to be getting them all out now.”\n",

      "NEW YORK (AP) — Black Friday bargains no longer tempt people to leave Thanksgiving tables for midnight mall runs. Brawls in store aisles over toys and TVs with limited-time discounts are spectacles of holidays past. Online shopping and retailers launching discounts weeks before the turkey feast subdued that kind of fervor.\n",
      "But the sales event still has enough enthusiasts to make the day after Thanksgiving the one when U.S. stores get the most shoppers coming in the door. For that reason, Black Friday still rules as the unofficial start of the holiday shopping season.\n",
      "This year's kickoff comes as consumer confidence in the U.S. economy fell this month in the aftermath of the federal government shutdown, weak hiring and stubborn inflation, according to a report The Conference Board issued Tuesday.\n",
      "Many retail executives have reported customers becoming more discerning and increasingly focused on deals while at the same time remaining willing to splash out for important occasions like the start of the school year and the winter holidays, creating a halo effect.\n",
      "“Consumers have been saying the economy is terrible while continuing to spend for years now, so the outlook is probably better than they are telling us,” Bill Adams, the chief economist at Comerica Bank, said this week of shoppers' moods heading into Black Friday. \"But business surveys also report consumers are being more sensitive to prices and selective in spending.\"\n",
      "While planning for the holidays in the spring and summer, retail companies were wrestling with the volatility of President Donald Trump ’s wide-ranging tariffs on imported goods. Many accelerated shipments of some merchandise before the tariffs took effect or decided to absorb some of the import tax costs instead of raising prices for customers.\n",
      "Market research firm Circana said that 40% of all general merchandise sold in September saw a price increase of at least 5% compared with the first four months of the year.\n",
      "Toys, baby products, housewares, and team sports equipment were among the hardest hit categories. For example, 83% of toys sold in September saw an increase of at least 5%, Circana said. Industry group The Toy Association says nearly 80% of the toys sold in the U.S. are made in China, a country the Trump administration hit with especially high tariffs at various points this year.\n",
      "Still, analysts and mall executives cited solid momentum heading into Black Friday week. At the Mall of America in Bloomington, Minnesota, foot traffic in recent weeks surpassed the numbers from pre-pandemic 2019, said Jill Renslow, the mall's chief business development and marketing officer.\n",
      "“We're seeing a very positive start to the holiday season,\" Renslow said. “The last few Saturdays in November have been very strong.”\n",
      "The growth in online sales also has been robust so far. From Nov. 1 to Nov. 23, consumers spent $79.7 billion, according to web tracking and analysis platform Adobe Analytics. That represented a gain of 7.5% from a year earlier and was bigger than Adobe's 5.3% growth forecast for the season.\n",
      "Mastercard SpendingPulse, which tracks spending across all payment methods, predicted a 3.6% increase in holiday sales from Nov. 1 through Dec. 24. That compares with a 4.1% increase last year.\n",
      "“Clearly, there’s uncertainty,” Mastercard Chief Economist Michelle Meyer said. “Clearly, consumers feel on edge. But at the moment, it doesn’t seem like it’s changing how they are showing up for this season.”\n",
      "According to Adobe Analytics, Thanksgiving Day was the best time to shop online to get the deepest discount on sporting goods. But Black Friday will be the best time to buy TVs, toys and appliances online.\n",
      "Cyber Monday, however, should be the best time to buy apparel and computers. Apparel discounts peaked at 12.2% off the suggested manufacturer’s price between Nov. 1 and Nov. 23 but are expected to hit 25% off on Cyber Monday, Adobe said.\n",

      "Decentralized finance protocol Balancer has outlined a framework to return millions in rescued assets to liquidity providers after an exploit drained more than $128 million from its V2 pools, in what was one of the largest DeFi exploits of the year.\n",
      "The proposal published Thursday by two members of the protocol’s community is seeking community feedback on plans to distribute roughly $8 million in funds, “including both whitehat rescues and internal recovery efforts.”\n",
      "The discussion comes in the aftermath of Balancer’s exploit early this month, which drained millions across five chains, forced emergency pauses, and prompted whitehat interventions.\n",
      "Approximately $28 million of the stolen funds were salvaged through a mix of whitehat interventions, internal rescues, and third-party actions, as per the proposal.\n",
      "\"Incidents like this show how important it is for DeFi to have clear, real-time visibility into what’s happening on-chain,\" Blockscout, an open-source block explorer for EVM-based chains, told Decrypt. \"The more transparent and traceable protocols become, the faster the ecosystem can respond, contain damage, and recover funds.\"\n",
      "The framework covers only the $8 million recovered directly by whitehats and Balancer’s internal teams, while Ethereum-based liquid staking protocol StakeWise will separately return the remaining $19.7 million in osETH and osGNO to its own users through its governance process.\n",
      "\"The Safe Harbor Agreement, adopted by Balancer DAO, provides clear terms for whitehat interventions,\" the proposal notes, specifying bounties are paid in the same tokens as recovered funds and cannot be retained directly from rescued assets.\n",
      "Balancer Exploited for $128 Million Across Ethereum Chains as Berachain Halts Network\n",
      "The proposal takes a non-socialized approach to reimbursement, meaning each affected pool's recovered funds will be distributed only to liquidity providers of that specific pool and network, rather than spreading losses across all users.\n",
      "Distributions will be proportional to holdings at specific snapshot blocks taken just before the first exploit transaction.\n",
      "Whitehat rescuers who intervened during the attack will receive a 10% bounty, capped at $1 million per operation, once they complete legal ID disclosure, KYC checks, and sanctions screening, according to the platform.\n",
      "The proposal identified six whitehat actors who recovered approximately $3.9 million across multiple networks during the exploit.\n",

      "Balancer also conducted an internal rescue operation, coordinating with security firm Certora, recovering an additional $4.1 million from vulnerable metastable pools across Ethereum, Optimism, and Arbitrum that were at risk but not yet exploited.\n",
      "These internally rescued funds won't qualify for SEAL Safe Harbor bounties since Certora operated under an existing service relationship with Balancer, and the agreement specifically incentivizes external actors rather than coordinated internal responses, as per the proposal.\n",
      "A claiming mechanism will be developed requiring claimants to provide digital proof of consent to Balancer's terms and conditions, explicitly agreeing to release Balancer Labs, Balancer DAO, Balancer Foundation, and affiliated parties from liabilities related to the exploit.\n",
      "The framework includes a 180-day claim period, after which unclaimed assets are classified as dormant and reassigned only through a subsequent governance decision.\n",

      "It's been over a year since the start of the new CEO Brian Niccol’s Back to Starbucks strategy, and the results of this strategy haven’t been as fruitful as initially expected. Starbucks' comparable sales have observed a consistent decline for several quarters. Despite the low base, its comparable sales haven’t observed the anticipated growth. In Q4 2025, the company’s North America comps remained flat year-over-year. However, international comps observed a 3% improvement, driven by 6% increase in comparable transactions, partially offset by 3% decline in average ticket.\n",
      "Its overall topline increased 5.5% year-over-year to $9.6 billion, beating the Street’s expectations. However, due to lower average ticket size in international markets and subdued performance in local markets, Starbucks’ margins got squeezed. Its adjusted EPS for the quarter plummeted 35% year-over-year to $0.52, missing the consensus estimates by 5.5%. SBUX stock prices have dropped 1.2% in the trading session following the release of its lackluster Q4 results on Oct. 29.\n",
      "When compared to its peer, Starbucks has significantly underperformed its peer, Dutch Bros Inc.’s (BROS) 11.3% surge in 2025 and 10% returns over the past 52 weeks.\n",

      "Volatility metrics tied to bitcoin (BTC) and the S&P 500 have are flashing green, signalling a potential synchronized year-end bull run amid surging Fed rate cut odds.\n",
      "Volmex's options-based 30-day bitcoin implied volatility index, BVIV, dropped back to an annualized 51%, reversing a sharp spike to nearly 65% over five days leading to Nov. 21, when bitcoin's price plunged from around $96,000 to nearly $80,000.\n",
      "Other volatility indicators, such as Deribit's DVOL, show similar spike and drop patterns, consistent with volatility swings on Wall Street.\n",
      "The VIX index, which measures the 30-day implied volatility in the S&P 500 , surged to 28% during the week leading up to Nov. 21 and has since eased back to 17%.\n",
      "The recent reversal in volatility trends suggests that panic is fading and bulls are regaining control, driving the price action higher. In other words, the path of least resistance appears to be upward as the final month of the year approaches.\n",
      "Bitcoin has recovered to over $91,000 since last Friday, continuing an inverse relationship with its volatility index. This shift to a negative correlation, seen since late last year, signals BTC’s evolution toward behaving more like a traditional asset.\n",
      "The volatility decline tracks surging odds for a December Fed rate cut, reigniting risk appetite and curbing demand for bitcoin put options as downside protection. This highlights markets' deep dependence on lower borrowing cost or cheap money.\n",
      "\"Markets are balancing on a knife’s edge, but sentiment has stabilised meaningfully as expectations of a rate cut continue to recover. The probability of a 25 basis point cut at the upcoming FOMC meeting collapsed to 39% just a week ago, yet has since surged back to nearly 87%,\" Dr. Sean Dawson, head of research at leading on-chain options platform, Derive, told CoinDesk.\n",
      "\"Volatility is cooling as well,\" Dawson added, explaining that the drop in volatility and unwinding of the strong put bias seen last week suggests that markets are pricing a lower probability of near-term disorder.\n",
      "On both Deribit and Derive, the renewed dovish shift in Fed rate cut bets has eased demand for BTC puts. As of writing, one-week and one-month call-put skews stand at around -5%, up from -7% to -10% last week.\n",
      "\"Traders are still paying a premium for downside protection, but noticeably less than last week, reflecting reduced fear and a partial unwind of defensive hedging as rate-cut odds firm,\" Dawson said.\n",

      "Atlanta, Georgia-based Southern Company (SO) engages in the generation, transmission, and distribution of electricity. With a market cap of $99.4 billion, Southern operates as one of the largest utility companies in the U.S. and serves millions of customers in Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Tennessee, Virginia, and other states.\n",
      "Companies worth $10 billion or more are generally referred to as “large-cap stocks.” Southern fits right into that category. Given the company’s extensive operations and influence and dominance in the utilities space, its valuation above this mark is unsurprising.\n",

      "Southern touched its all-time high of $100.83 on Oct. 16, and is currently trading 10.5% below that peak. Meanwhile, SO stock prices have declined 3.1% over the past three months, lagging behind the Utilities Select Sector SPDR Fund’s (XLU) 5.6% gains during the same time frame.\n",
      "Southern has underperformed the broader utilities space over the longer term as well. SO stock prices have gained 9.6% in 2025 and observed 1% uptick over the past 52 weeks, compared to XLU’s 18.9% surge on a YTD basis and 8.6% returns over the past year.\n",
      "Southern dropped below its 50-day moving average in late October and below its 200-day moving average in early November, underscoring its recent downturn.\n",
      "Southern’s stock prices gained 1.7% in the trading session following the release of its better-than-expected Q3 results on Oct. 30. Driven by notable growth in fuel and non-fuel, retail and wholesale electric revenues, natural gas revenues, and other revenues, the company’s overall topline grew 7.5% year-over-year to $7.8 billion, beating the Street’s expectations by 3.8%. Further, its adjusted EPS surged 11.9% year-over-year to $1.60, surpassing the consensus estimates by a notable 6.7%.\n",
      "However, Southern has also underperformed compared to its peer NextEra Energy, Inc.’s (NEE) 19.3% surge in 2025 and 10.4% gains over the past 52 weeks.\n",
      "Among the 24 analysts covering Southern stock, the consensus rating is a “Hold.” As of writing, its mean price target of $100.83 suggests an 11.7% upside potential from current price levels.\n",

      "Investing in a climate crisis: Are cat bonds a win for your portfolio?\n",
      "Euronews \n",
      "No tickers found\n",
      "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/investing-climate-crisis-cat-bonds-060134806.html\n",
      "Eleanor Butler\n",
      "Fri, November 28, 2025 at 1:01 PM GMT+7\n",
      "Catastrophe bonds — as the name may suggest — aren’t for fledgling investors. Even so, these high-yield, high-risk securities are attracting growing interest as natural catastrophes intensify.\n",
      "First developed for the US market in the 1990s, cat bonds are issued by governments, insurers, or reinsurers to cover the costs of natural disasters. Investors buy the instrument in the hope that a payout won’t be triggered, meaning they’ll get their money back plus a return. Alternatively, in the case of a bond-triggering natural disaster, the issuer will keep the capital to cover the fallout.\n",
      "“From the perspective of insurers and reinsurers, cat bonds provide access to an alternative source of capital that is more flexible than on-balance sheet capital and can be targeted towards absorbing specific types and layers of risk,” said Brandan Holmes, VP-senior credit officer at Moody’s Ratings. “Cat bonds can also be more cost effective than traditional reinsurance,” he told Euronews.\n",
      "The appeal of these securities has gained prominence in the wake of recent disasters like Jamaica’s Hurricane Melissa. Crucially, capital markets provide nations with a vital means to lower insurance costs at a time when aid spending in rich countries is dropping. Repeated natural disasters can push governments into insurmountable debt, particularly as the cost of servicing those dues becomes higher.\n",
      "From an investor perspective, the instrument also has its perks. Not only do the bonds carry attractive yields because of their risky nature, they provide portfolio diversification because of their limited correlation with financial markets. This means that when stocks and typical bonds fall at the same time — an uncommon but real scenario — catastrophe bonds offer some protection. “They also tend to have relatively short maturities which provide investors with flexibility in asset allocation decisions,” said Holmes.\n",
      "According to data firm Artemis, the outstanding value of the global cat bond market is around $57.9 billion (€49.93bn). Despite the growing climate risk, these assets also saw historically strong returns in 2023 and 2024, reaching 20% and 17% respectively.\n",
      "One factor boosting returns is that investors only pay out if certain conditions are met. For example, when Hurricane Beryl hit Jamaica last year, the nation failed to get any cat bond coverage when air pressure failed to drop below a certain threshold. On the other hand, in the wake of this year’s Hurricane Melissa, Jamaica will receive a full payout of $150 million (€129.37mn) thanks to its World Bank catastrophe insurance.\n",
      "Analysts stress that the complex conditions surrounding cat bonds make the product unsuitable for inexperienced investors. “You have to have a really good understanding of the risk passed on,” said Maren Josefs, credit analyst at S&P Global. She added: “What we’ve also seen recently is investors presuming they are investing in extreme events, like a really big hurricane or earthquake. But over the last few years, mid-sized events such as tornadoes, wildfires, or floods have been happening with greater frequency, meaning some investors were surprised when they lost money to these sorts of natural disasters.”\n",

      "Why investors are ditching bonds for gold in 2025\n",
      "Institutional investors are currently the key purchasers of cat bonds. However, there are ways for retail investors to gain indirect exposure to the product. Earlier this year, the world’s first ETF (exchange traded fund) investing in cat bonds made its debut on the New York Stock Exchange, meaning fund managers can now pool investor contributions to buy cat bonds. In the EU, the instruments aren’t easy for non-professionals to access, but indirect exposure is possible through UCITS, a type of mutual fund.\n",
      "“The actual cat bond that gets issued, there's no way that either a US or EU retail investor can just buy that,” said Johannes Schahn, an associate at Mayer Brown who advises on debt issuance. “They’re only offered to qualified investors,” he continued, “but what has been happening occasionally is that mutual funds invest or partially invest in cat bonds.”\n",
      "Despite the perks of these securities, their availability may be further restricted in the EU in the coming years. This comes after a report from the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA), sent to the European Commission this summer, advising that cat bonds shouldn’t be included in UCITS. The market watchdog clarified that UCITS should only hold a small indirect exposure of up to 10% to these instruments.\n",
      "While ESMA’s recommendation has ignited conversations around the risks of cat bonds for non-professional investors, Kian Navid, senior policy officer for investment management at ESMA, told Euronews that the advice sent to the Commission wasn’t passing a value judgement on the investments. “It is not that ESMA’s technical advice takes a position against retail investors accessing cat bonds per se. The advice is not about outlining what constitutes a good or bad investment, but it provides data and risk analyses for the European Commission’s consideration,” he explained. “However, conceptually, if you opened up UCITS to alternative assets (like cat bonds) beyond 10%, that would risk blurring the lines between UCITS and alternative investment funds (AIFs).”\n",
      "A decision from the Commission is still pending, and this will involve public consultations and further market analysis in 2026. Even so, it remains to be seen whether catastrophe bonds will appeal to European tastes.\n",
      "“It’s a product that is established in the US market and less so in Europe,” said Patrick Scholl, partner at Mayer Brown. “I don’t know if there are many interested investors here… But if we see more catastrophe-driven developments in the region, we might see more of these products in Europe.”\n",

      "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/hinkley-point-c-nuclear-power-060000201.html\n",
      "Jonathan Leake\n",
      "Fri, November 28, 2025 at 1:00 PM GMT+7\n",
      "The troubled Hinkley Point C nuclear power station will add £1bn annually to UK energy bills as soon as it’s switched on, official figures show.\n",
      "The money will be taken from consumers and handed to the French owner EDF to subsidise operations, making it one of the UK’s most expensive sources of electricity.\n",
      "A further £1bn will be added to bills by a separate nuclear levy, supporting construction of the Sizewell C nuclear power station in Suffolk, also led by EDF. Campaigners branded it a “nuclear tax on households”.\n",
      "Details were revealed in documents released by the Treasury and the Office for Budget Responsibility in the wake of Rachel Reeves’s Budget.\n",
      "They describe how EDF will be entitled to claim the money under the “Contracts for Difference” subsidy system as soon as Hinkley C begins operations, probably in 2030.\n",
      "The documents state: “In 2030-31, Contracts for Difference (CfDs) are expected to generate £4.6bn in government receipts, including £1bn to fund subsidy payments to the Hinkley Point C nuclear power plant for its first year of expected generation.”\n",
      "The impact on bills is linked to a 2013 agreement reached between EDF and Sir Ed Davey, the then energy secretary. He guaranteed that EDF could charge £92.50 per megawatt hour (MWh) of power once Hinkley Point C came online. With inflation, this equates to £133 today and is expected to reach about £150 in 2030.\n",
      "If the wholesale cost of electricity remains at its current level of about £80/MWh, then EDF can claim an extra £70 from consumers and businesses via CfDs.\n",
      "From January, energy bills will also be hit by an entirely separate levy designed to support the construction of another nuclear power station at Sizewell in Suffolk.\n",
      "The Regulated Asset Base levy will add £10 a year to power bills from 2026, raising £700m, but will roughly double by 2030, when it will need to raise £1.4bn a year for Sizewell.\n",
      "Official modelling suggests Sizewell C’s final costs could reach £100bn.\n",
      "Bills could rise even further once approval is given for another nuclear site on Anglesey in north Wales, where the UK’s first small modular reactors are planned.\n",
      "Alison Downes, of Stop Sizewell C, said nuclear power had proven to be among the most expensive ways of generating electricity.\n",
      "She said: “The Government has a misguided belief that nuclear will be a cheap, ‘green’ solution to our energy needs, but the evidence shows the opposite – that costs of delivery and of dealing with nuclear waste – will continue to rise.\n",
      "“We remain opposed to the imposition of a nuclear tax on households, given the acknowledged uncertainty about the projected costs of constructing Sizewell C.”\n",
      "The surging cost of CfDs is part of a much broader increase in energy-related environmental levies. These add £14bn to energy bills at the moment, but this will rise to £19bn by the end of the decade, according to Treasury forecasts.\n",
      "The CfD subsidy system, which also supports wind and solar, currently costs consumers and businesses £2.3bn a year, but those costs will hit £4.6bn by 2030-31.\n",
      "Meanwhile, the Renewables Obligation, which funded the UK’s first wind farms, adds costs of £8bn a year.\n",
      "The Capacity Market, which pays gas-fired power stations and hydroelectric facilities to be on standby in case wind and solar are hit by low wind and light levels, adds a further £1.6bn.\n",
      "A government spokesman said the subsidies were necessary to unleash its planned “golden age of nuclear power”.\n",
      "They said: “Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C will each deliver clean electricity for six million households for at least six decades. Sizewell C could save £2bn a year across the future low-carbon electricity system once operational, resulting in cheaper power for consumers.”\n",
      "Hinkley C was initially forecast to cost £18bn, but spiralling construction costs have pushed the total bill to £46bn, equivalent to £700 per person in the UK.\n",

      "(Bloomberg) -- Investors in Chinese electric vehicle stocks had been hoping for a strong earnings season to provide a fresh tailwind. Instead, disappointing results have stoked anxiety about what lies ahead.\n",
      "The sector was riding high — with Xpeng Inc.’s year-to-date gain exceeding 130% earlier this month — buoyed by a surge in global risk appetite and an improved outlook for Chinese assets. But signs of pressure at even established firms like BYD Co. have raised new questions over the industry’s profitability after its rapid expansion.\n",

      "Attention is now shifting to how Chinese EV makers will fare next year, with domestic demand expected to soften as government policy support wanes. Earnings may suffer further with costs seen rising and discounts for consumers likely to continue.\n",
      "“We expect the demand environment in 1Q 2026 to be challenging, particularly after nearly two years of national trade-in and scrappage policies” that boosted EV purchases, said Bing Yuan, a fund manager at Edmond de Rothschild Asset Management. Competition may intensify, hurting margins into next year, she added.\n",
      "Traders quickly turned against the best‑performing stocks as results fell short. Xpeng shares dropped 10% in Hong Kong the day after it reported continued losses and issued weak guidance. Zhejiang Leapmotor Technology Co. touched its lowest level since April after its profit came in at less than 65% of the analyst estimate even as sales nearly doubled.\n",
      "Li Auto Inc. and Nio Inc. were among others issuing fourth-quarter revenue and vehicle delivery forecasts that missed market expectations. The outlooks suggest sluggish consumer demand in what is a critical period for automakers striving to hit annual sales targets.\n",
      "Analysts had projected a bump in deliveries toward the end of this year, given that taxes on EV purchases will be phasing back in from 2026 following years of exemptions. Things are likely to only worsen next year, with Bloomberg Intelligence estimating China’s new energy vehicle growth will slow to 13% versus 27% this year.\n",
      "Geely Automobile Holdings Ltd. this month launched a rebate of up to 15,000 yuan ($2119) to make up for the scaling back of tax breaks. Other makers have done so as well, including Li Auto and Xiaomi Corp.\n",
      "Such offers combined with rising battery costs will be “headwinds for margins,” said Daisy Li, a fund manager at EFG Asset Management. So earnings pressure will remain even as companies start to move away from fierce price wars on a push from Beijing’s “anti‑involution” campaign, she added.\n",
      "Manufacturers of lower-priced vehicles like BYD, Geely and Leapmotor are likely better-positioned for next year’s market downturn, said Xiao Feng, co-head of China industrial research at CLSA Hong Kong.\n",
      "“We continue to see a clear downgrading trend, with buyers who once chose mid‑ to high‑end models now shifting toward mass‑market cars,” said Feng. Such models also sell well outside of China, he added.\n",
      "Some makers are in fact expanding in overseas markets where they can sell products at higher prices as a way to bolster margins. BYD’s overseas sales volume more than doubled from a year earlier in the third quarter, fueled by demand in Europe and Latin America. Geely expects sales volume outside China to surge as much as 80% next year.\n",
      "Others are looking beyond EVs for future growth. Xpeng plans to mass-produce humanoids by the end of 2026, while Li Auto aims to transform vehicles into “embodied AI” robots, according to comments in their earnings briefings.\n",
      "Such efforts may take time to bear fruit. For now, China’s EV segment faces a murky outlook.\n",
      "“Investors would be reluctant to increase investments in this sector without policy clarity for 2026,” UBS Securities Asia Ltd. analysts including Paul Gong wrote in a note. “We stay cautious on the sector, especially the outperformers under the stimulus cycle.”\n",

      "The native token of the newly launched Layer-1 blockchain, Monad, suffered further losses on Thursday amid volatility that has plagued the token since its debut roughly three days ago.\n",
      "The crypto is down 15% over the last 24 hours to $0.03 after dropping from $0.04 late into the U.S. trading session. It remains up 47% since its November 25 debut, thanks mainly to its solid rise from an opening price of around $0.02, according to CoinGecko data.\n",
      "Some signs point to early token holders booking profits with a bid-ask delta indicator at 10% order book depth turning negative after Monad stabilized around $0.47 on November 26.\n",
      "In other words, the orderbook imbalance shows sellers are currently outweighing buyers in that specific price zone. Derivatives traders have also amplified the spot-driven decline.\n",
      "Steady open interest, coupled with a steep decline in the cumulative volume delta, suggests that new short positions are being opened, adding downward pressure to the drop.\n",
      "\"Expectations are still constructive long term: investors are looking for real workloads, genuine developer traction, and ecosystem partners to validate Monad’s high-throughput thesis,\" Shivam Thakral, CEO of Indian crypto exchange BuyUCoin, told Decrypt. \"But after the recent drop, the market will demand evidence, not just benchmarks, before re-rating the asset.\"\n",

      "The sharp price correction stands in stark contrast to the network's usage metrics, which have attracted nearly 150,000 active users and recorded 4.7 million on-chain transactions, according to Artemis data.\n",

      "McKesson Corporation (MCK), rooted in 1833, has transformed from a modest drug importer into a formidable global healthcare services force. Based in Irving, Texas, it now commands a vast distribution network spanning pharmaceuticals, medical-surgical supplies, and advanced technology solutions for hospitals, pharmacies, and major health systems. Its scale, logistical strength, and deep integration across the healthcare supply chain position McKesson as an indispensable pillar of modern medical infrastructure. Its market capitalization stands at $109.1 billion.\n",
      "McKesson’s sheer scale secures its “large-cap” status effortlessly, easily surpassing the $10 billion benchmark without breaking a sweat. This size represents decades of built infrastructure, deep distributor relationships, and diversified revenue lines that shield it from volatility in any one business segment. McKesson is big and entrenched, essential, and fully embedded in how the U.S. healthcare system moves, stores, and delivers medicine. Its distribution network alone spans thousands of facilities, making it one of the few players capable of handling high-volume pharmaceutical demand at a national scale.\n",

      "That dominance has turned into strong market traction lately. Shares of the healthcare giant hit a record high of $895.58 on Nov. 26 before easing 1.3%. Even with that minor pullback, the stock has been a standout performer. MCK has surged nearly 30% over the past three months, crushing the S&P 500 Index’s ($SPX) 5.1% gain in the same period.\n",
      "And the long-term picture is even brighter. McKesson’s shares have climbed 55.1% year-to-date (YTD) and 41.4% over the past 52 weeks, doubling and even tripling the broader market’s momentum. By comparison, the SPX is up just 15.8% YTD and 13.6% over the past 52 weeks.\n",
      "The technical picture strongly supports that strength. MCK has traded above its 200-day moving average throughout the past year. Its 50-day moving average has also acted like a supportive trendline, cracked a bit in July, but the stock snapped back above it by September. Since then, MCK has marched higher, confirming a bullish setup with both key moving averages trending firmly upward.\n",
      "Fueling that rally is a powerful mix of operational execution and financial momentum. On Nov. 6, shares jumped nearly 1.7% after the company delivered robust fiscal Q2 results the day before. Revenue rose 10.1% year over year (YoY) to $103.2 billion, supported by higher prescription volumes and increased distribution of oncology and multispecialty drugs – two categories with steady, long-term demand.\n",
      "EPS surged 377% YoY to $8.92, helped by lapping divestiture-related charges, and management lifted its adjusted EPS outlook to $38.35 to $38.85 range for fiscal 2026. McKesson’s deeper push into specialty pharmaceuticals and its expanding partnerships with major healthcare providers are also strengthening investor confidence.\n",
      "While competition remains intense in the medical distribution area, rival Cencora, Inc. (COR) rose 48.3% over the past 52 weeks and jumped 67% on a YTD basis, outperforming MCK’s double-digit rallies.\n",
      "Yet Wall Street remains firmly in McKesson’s corner. Among 16 analysts covering MCK, the stock has a “Strong Buy” rating, with a mean price target of $936.80, implying 6% upside potential from current levels.\n",

      "Moline, Illinois-based Deere & Company (DE) is a leading American multinational headquartered in Moline, Illinois, and one of the world’s largest manufacturers of agricultural, construction, forestry, and turf-care equipment. Founded in 1837, the company has evolved from producing steel plows to advanced machinery for precision agriculture and heavy equipment for infrastructure and forestry. Deere operates through key segments including Production & Precision Agriculture, Small Agriculture & Turf, Construction & Forestry, and Financial Services, supplying equipment and financing solutions to customers globally.\n",
      "Companies worth $10 billion or more are generally described as \"large-cap stocks.\" Deere fits right into that category, with a market cap of $127 billion that exceeds this threshold, reflecting its substantial size, influence, and dominance in the farm & heavy construction machinery industry.\n",

      "Despite its notable strengths, DE stock has plunged 12% from its all-time high of $533.78 touched on May 16. Meanwhile, the stock has dropped 3.7% over the past three months, notably underperforming the broader Nasdaq Composite’s ($NASX) 7.8% rise during the same time frame.\n",
      "However, over the longer term, Deere’s performance has remained much more impressive. DE stock has surged 10.9% on a YTD basis and 1.9% over the past 52 weeks, notably outperforming NASX’s 20.2% uptick in 2025 and 21.1% surge over the past year.\n",
      "DE stock has remained mostly below its 200-day moving average since early September. But the stock has traded mostly above its 50-day moving average recently.\n",
      "On Nov. 26, DE announced its Q4 2025 performance and its shares dropped 5.7%. Its net sales and revenues fell 9% year-over-year to $12.02 billion, driven by broad softness across its core equipment businesses. Net income declined sharply to $1.29 billion or $4.75 per share from $1.73 billion or $6.29 per share a year earlier, and operating profit dropped 32% to $1.57 billion as margins compressed.\n",
      "The downturn was led by the Production & Precision Agriculture segment, where sales fell 16% and operating profit slid 50%, while Construction & Forestry also saw sales down 5% and profit nearly halved. The company cited challenging market conditions, weaker equipment demand, and macro headwinds, and narrowed its full-year net-income guidance to $4.75–$5.25 billion, dampening investor sentiment.\n",
      "Meanwhile, Deere’s peer Caterpillar Inc. (CAT) has gained 58.2% on a YTD basis and 40.7% over the past year, outperforming DE.\n",
      "Among the 23 analysts covering the DE stock, the overall consensus rating is a “Moderate Buy.” Its mean price target of $525.77 suggests an 11.9% upside potential from current price levels.\n",

      "STEVE KARNOWSKI and GENE JOHNSON\n",
      "Fri, November 28, 2025 at 12:01 PM GMT+7\n",
      "MINNEAPOLIS (AP) — The production lines at Indeed Brewing moved quickly, the cans filling not with beer, but with THC-infused seltzer. The product, which features the compound that gets cannabis users high, has been a lifeline at Indeed and other craft breweries as alcohol sales have fallen in recent years.\n",
      "But that boom looks set to come to a crashing halt. Buried in the bill that ended the federal government shutdown this month was a provision to ban those drinks, along with other impairing beverages and snacks made from hemp, which have proliferated across the country in recent years. Now the $24 billion hemp industry is scrambling to save itself before the provision takes effect in November 2026.\n",
      "“It’s a big deal,\" said Ryan Bandy, Indeed's chief business officer. \"It would be a mess for our breweries, for our industry, and obviously for a lot of people who like these things.”\n",
      "Here's what to know about the looming ban on impairing products derived from hemp.\n",
      "Congress opened the door in 2018\n",
      "Marijuana and hemp are the same species. Marijuana is cultivated for high levels of THC in its flowers. Low-THC hemp is grown for its sturdy fibers, food or wellness products. “Rope, not dope” was long the motto of farmers who supported legalizing hemp.\n",
      "After states began legalizing marijuana for adult use over a decade ago, hemp advocates saw an opening at the federal level. As part of the 2018 farm bill, Congress legalized the cultivation of industrial hemp to give farmers, including in Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell's home state of Kentucky, a new cash crop.\n",
      "But the way that law defined hemp — as having less than 0.3% of a specific type of THC, called delta-9 — opened a huge loophole. Beverages or bags of snacks could meet that threshold and still contain more than enough THC to get people high. Businesses could further exploit the law by extracting a non-impairing compound, called CBD, and chemically changing it into other types of impairing THC, such as delta-8 or delta-10.\n",
      "The result? Vape oil, gummy candies, chips, cookies, sodas and other unregulated, untested products laden with hemp-derived THC spread around the country. In many places, they have been available at gas stations or convenience stores, even to teens. In legal marijuana states, they undercut heavily taxed and regulated products. In others, they evaded the prohibition on recreational use of weed.\n",
      "Some states, including Indiana, have reported spikes in calls to poison-control centers for pediatric exposure to THC.\n",
      "A patchwork of state regulations\n",
      "Dozens of states have since taken steps to regulate or ban impairing hemp products. In October, Democratic California Gov. Gavin Newsom signed a bill banning the sale of intoxicating hemp products outside the state's legal marijuana system.\n",
      "Texas, which has a massive hemp market, is moving to regulate sales of impairing hemp, such as by restricting them to those over 21. In Nebraska, lawmakers have instead considered a bill to criminalize the sale and possession of products containing hemp-based THC.\n",
      "Washington state adopted a program to regulate hemp growing. But the number of licensed growers has cratered since the state banned intoxicating hemp products outside of the regulated cannabis market in 2023. Five years ago, there were 220, said Trecia Ehrlich, cannabis program manager with the state agriculture department. This year, there were 42, and with a federal ban looming, she expects that number to drop by about half next year.\n",
      "Minnesota made infused beverages and foods legal in 2022 for people 21 and older. The products, which must be derived from legally certified hemp, have become so popular that Target is now offering THC drinks at some of its stores in the state.\n",
      "They've also been a boon to liquor stores and to small Minneapolis brewers like Indeed, where THC drinks make up close to one-quarter of the business, Bandy said. At Bauhaus Brew Labs, a few blocks away, THC drinks account for 26% of their revenues from distributed products and 11% of revenues at the brewery’s taproom.\n",
      "A powerful senator moves to close the loophole\n",
      "None of that was what McConnell intended when he helped craft the 2018 farm bill. He finally closed the loophole by inserting a federal hemp THC ban in the measure to end the 43-day federal government shutdown, approved by the Senate on Nov. 10.\n",
      "“It will keep these dangerous products out of the hands of children, while preserving the hemp industry for farmers,” McConnell said. “Industrial hemp and CBD will remain legal for industrial applications.”\n",
      "Some in the legal marijuana industry celebrated, as the ban would end what they consider unfair competition.\n",
      "They were joined by prohibitionists. “There’s really no good argument for allowing these dangerous products to be sold in our country,” said Kevin Sabet, president and CEO of Smart Approaches to Marijuana.\n",
      "But the ban doesn't take effect for a year. That has given the industry hope that there is still time to pass regulations that will improve the hemp THC industry — such as by banning synthetically derived THC, requiring age restrictions on sales, and prohibiting marketing to children — rather than eradicate it.\n",
      "\"We are very hopeful that cooler heads will prevail,\" said Jonathan Miller, general counsel of the industry group U.S. Hemp Roundtable. “If they really thought there was a health emergency, there would be no year-long period.”\n",
      "The federal ban would jeopardize more than 300,000 jobs while costing states $1.5 billion in lost tax money, the group says.\n",
      "Drew Hurst, president and chief operating officer at Bauhaus Brew Labs, has no doubt his company would be among the casualties.\n",
      "“If this goes through as written currently, I don’t see a way at all that Bauhaus could stay in business,\" Hurst said.\n",
      "What comes next?\n",
      "A number of lawmakers say they will push for regulation of the hemp THC industry. Kentucky's second senator, Republican Rand Paul, introduced an amendment to strip McConnell's hemp language from the crucial government-funding bill, but it failed on a lopsided 76-24 vote.\n",
      "Minnesota's Democratic U.S. senators, Amy Klobuchar and Tina Smith, are among those strategizing to save the industry. Klobuchar noted at a recent news conference that the ban was inserted into the unrelated shutdown bill without a hearing. She suggested the federal government could allow states to develop their own regulatory frameworks, or that Minnesota's strict regulations could be used as a national model.\n",
      "Kevin Hilliard, co-founder of Insight Brewing in Minneapolis, said the hemp industry needs a solution before planting time next spring.\n",
      "\"If a farmer has uncertainty, they’re not going to plant,” Hilliard said.\n",

      "Santa won't be the only one tightening his belt this year — the American consumer is already feeling the pinch, and many haven't even finished digesting their Thanksgiving stuffing. As we head into Black Friday weekend, the forecast for holiday shoppers may be chilly: prices on consumer goods are rising faster than is comfortable for many gift-givers, according to two recent reports by Bank of America.\n",
      "Sixty-two percent of the more than 2,000 respondents to Bank of America's holiday survey, conducted in late summer, said they expected financial strain tied to holiday expenses, and 58% say gifts feel more expensive.\n",
      "More than half of the respondents pointed to tariffs as a suspected cause. The firm found that tariffs announced this spring likely contributed to price increases in categories such as electronics and jewelry, goods often purchased as holiday gifts.\n",
      "Holiday spending per household is up about 6% according to the bank's card data, yet retail transaction volumes have declined slightly over the course of the year. The takeaway: shoppers are shelling out more, only to walk away with less.\n",
      "BofA's reports also point to a widening chasm in how those along different income brackets are likely to experience the season's bounty.\n",
      "Higher-income households continue to show spending and wage growth that outpace everyone else. Many white-collar professionals, such as Wall Street investment bankers, are expected to have surging bonus years, according to forecasts, which is likely to hand six-figure year-end incentive pay for higher-income earners.\n",
      "For everyone else, the most wonderful time of the year is already fomenting stress at the checkout counter.\n",
      "Electronics spending per transaction jumped nearly 8% in a single month after the spring tariffs, and jewelry spending rose about four percentage points after an August tariff announcement, the bank found. Add in record-high gold prices this year — which have made gold-based pieces costlier — and suddenly, holiday gift-giving has relinquished some of its luster.\n",
      "With rising prices leaving some shoppers with fewer items to buy, survey respondents say they're getting more selective about who will end up on their \"naughty\" or \"nice\" lists.\n",
      "Thirty-eight percent say they'll only buy gifts for immediate family and close friends, while 23% have agreed with relatives to scale back their gift-giving.\n",
      "Among those feeling financial strain, 87% plan to shop at discount stores to counter rising prices, and 51% say they'd consider gifting a \"dupe,\" a cheaper imitation of a luxury item. More than half said they planned to kick off their shopping sprees earlier than usual to spread out expenses, the survey found.\n",
      "Card data showed that spending by high earners increased roughly 3% over the past year, compared with less than 1% for lower-income households. The firm said wage growth followed a similar split — after-tax pay rose about 4% for higher earners, but only about 1% for those at the bottom. Goldman Sachs, meanwhile, is warning that the labor market is softening across tech, manufacturing, and other sectors, which could squeeze those already on the edge.\n",
      "That means, with prices climbing and paychecks under pressure, holiday shoppers may be left wondering who's actually going to come down the chimney this year: Santa Claus with a sack of toys, or the Grinch, offering only an inflationary pinch.\n",

      "Dogecoin cracked below the $0.152 floor in a high-volume breakdown that erased the previous week’s stability, as ETF inflow momentum collapsed and sellers overwhelmed key support zones.\n",
      "The newly launched DOGE ETFs saw their first clear demand shock as inflows plunged from $1.8 million to just $365,420 — an 80% single-session collapse.\n",
      "The sharp drop in institutional participation came as broader crypto markets attempted recovery, with Bitcoin retesting $92,000 and high-beta altcoins rebounding sharply.\n",
      "DOGE underperformed the sector by a wide margin. While BNB, Solana, and Avalanche printed multi-percentage gains, DOGE faced persistent distribution pressure, amplified by weak ETF demand and fading speculative flows.\n",
      "Meme coin products, which often show intense initial interest followed by swift cooling, continued that historical pattern as DOGE liquidity thinned at the same moment technical levels failed.\n",
      "The break below $0.152 established a clear shift from consolidation into a defined downtrend.\n",
      "Lower highs, combined with repeated failures to retest the $0.155 zone, created a descending structure that tightened into the early morning session before breaking decisively.\n",
      "Volume confirms the move: a 265M surge (67% above average) during the breakdown validates a genuine structural failure rather than a low-liquidity wick. The 16.6M spike at 02:08 UTC highlights where supply overwhelmed bids, triggering rapid continuation toward the $0.150 psychological threshold.\n",
      "Momentum has now flipped decisively bearish. The trend structure shows clean stair-step declines, and Fibonacci retracement projections between $0.1495 and $0.1478 align with the next liquidity pockets.\n",
      "Indicators show no bullish divergences yet, suggesting sellers maintain control until deeper tests of the lower range are completed.\n",
      "DOGE traded from $0.1548 down to $0.1502 over the session, with the heaviest selling concentrated during early morning hours. The breakdown accelerated precisely as ETF inflow data hit markets, creating a synchronized technical-fundamental sell trigger.\n",
      "Attempts to stabilize near $0.151 repeatedly failed, turning that region into immediate overhead resistance. By the end of the session DOGE drifted sideways above $0.1500, with narrowing ranges and declining volume pointing to temporary exhaustion but no confirmed reversal.\n",
      "The psychological $0.150 level is now the only meaningful near-term support before deeper retracement zones activate.\n",
      "DOGE sits at a fragile juncture. Losing $0.1500 opens the path directly into $0.1495 Fibonacci territory, followed by a heavier liquidity cluster near $0.147.\n",
      "Any recovery attempt must reclaim $0.152 quickly — without that, momentum remains decisively bearish.\n",
      "ETF inflow disappointment compounds the chart damage; unless institutional demand returns, technicals will dominate price action.\n",
      "Traders should expect continued correlation with Bitcoin’s intraday direction and remain vigilant around volatility spikes, as DOGE remains highly sensitive to liquidity shifts and whale activity.\n",

      "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/uk-auto-production-plunges-31-035719232.html\n",
      "Charles Kennedy\n",
      "Fri, November 28, 2025 at 10:57 AM GMT+7\n",
      "UK automotive production plunged in October, with combined car and commercial vehicle output falling 30.9% year-on-year to 62,116 units, according to new data released by the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). The sharp contraction reflects both the ongoing fallout from a major cyber incident that disrupted operations at Britain’s largest carmaker and wider structural pressures in the country’s auto sector.\n",
      "Car production dropped 23.8% to 59,010 units, leaving factories 18,474 vehicles short of October 2024 levels. The decline marks the first month of a phased restart following the cyberattack that forced a temporary production halt earlier this autumn. Output for the domestic market fell 10.6% to 13,785 units, while exports slid 27.1% to 45,225. Shipments to the UK’s largest overseas markets, particularly the EU, US and Japan, recorded declines, though exports to Türkiye and China rose.\n",
      "Commercial vehicle manufacturing endured an even steeper decline, tumbling 74.9% to just 3,106 units, its seventh consecutive monthly drop. The SMMT attributed the collapse primarily to a major manufacturer consolidating its operations in the North West, a move that has temporarily depressed national volumes.\n",
      "Despite the grim headline figures, one bright spot was the continued rise of electrified vehicle production. Nearly half of all cars built in October, 46.2%, were battery-electric, plug-in hybrid or hybrid models. Electrified output rose 10.4% to 27,287 units, underscoring the UK industry’s pivot toward EV manufacturing even as domestic demand remains under pressure.\n",
      "The production update comes two days after the UK government’s Autumn Budget, which included several measures welcomed by manufacturers. These included a £1.5 billion increase in Automotive Transformation Fund support, a deferral of regulations affecting employee car ownership schemes, and the launch of a consultation on a new British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme aimed at reducing industrial energy costs, long a sticking point for UK manufacturers competing with international rivals.\n",
      "However, industry leaders warned that new tax measures could weaken the UK’s appeal just as policymakers are trying to attract major EV investment. The government confirmed plans for a new pay-per-mile electric vehicle tax (eVED), a move that could suppress EV demand at the very moment automakers are required to increase sales under the country’s Zero Emission Vehicle (ZEV) mandate.\n",
      "“In introducing a new electric vehicle Excise Duty, the government risks undermining demand for the very vehicles manufacturers are compelled to sell,” said SMMT Chief Executive Mike Hawes. “This is the wrong measure at the wrong time.”\n",
      "Year-to-date, UK factories have produced 644,366 vehicles, down 17% from the same period in 2024. Yet the latest independent outlook from Auto Analysis forecasts a return to growth in 2026, with output expected to reach 828,000 units as new electric models come online. Under favourable industrial conditions, UK production could climb toward 1 million units by 2030, the report suggests.\n",
      "The SMMT cautioned that October’s data includes provisional figures from one manufacturer and may be revised. The next production release is scheduled for 19 December 2025.\n",

      "XRP slipped back under the $2.20 threshold as a daily death cross renewed selling pressure, setting the token up for a critical support test that may determine whether the broader correction accelerates into December.\n",
      "XRP failed to sustain ETF-driven strength — despite Franklin Templeton’s XRPZ and Grayscale’s GXRP posting three consecutive sessions of net inflows.\n",
      "Binance exchange reserves fell to 2.7 billion XRP, the lowest in more than a year, after roughly 300 million XRP left the platform since October.\n",
      "This indicates long-term holders and institutional desks continue to accumulate into weakness, but spot demand has not yet offset short-term liquidation flows driven by derivatives unwinding and risk-off sentiment across crypto.\n",
      "The breakdown from $2.22 to $2.18 confirmed a clean rejection at the $2.23–$2.24 resistance zone, reinforcing a descending channel that has guided XRP’s price for the past two weeks.\n",
      "The death cross adds structural weight to this pattern, aligning with a series of lower highs at $2.185, $2.180, and $2.178.\n",
      "Momentum readings remain soft. RSI failed to reclaim the midline on every bounce attempt, indicating persistent selling pressure, while MACD continues drifting deeper into negative territory.\n",
      "Price remains below all major short-term moving averages, and the slope of the 50-day average is now accelerating downward — a condition that historically reinforces follow-through selling rather than immediate reversals.\n",
      "Despite this, on-chain flows show an improving underlying bid: steady ETF inflows and shrinking exchange balances suggest a transition toward mid-term accumulation even as the near-term chart remains decisively bearish.\n",
      "The token briefly stabilized at $2.17–$2.18 during the final hours as activity thinned out, reflecting a pause in aggressive selling but not a meaningful recovery attempt.\n",
      "Overnight price action recovered slightly toward $2.21 before retreating, leaving XRP range-bound but vulnerable.\n",
      "XRP now sits directly on top of the $2.17–$2.18 decision zone. Losing this shelf exposes $2.08, followed by the broader $1.90 region highlighted by analysts as the key line separating routine correction from deeper retracement.\n",
      "To regain upward momentum, XRP must reclaim $2.20 and then break through $2.23–$2.24 with expanding volume — without both, any bounce remains corrective.\n",
      "Historical death-cross behavior suggests downside risk remains elevated until price reclaims the 50-day average. ETF inflows help limit structural damage but cannot override short-term technical weakness on their own.\n",

      "MegaETH will return all user funds deposited into its pre-launch “Pre-Deposit Bridge,” reversing a campaign that was meant to preload liquidity for USDm — the stablecoin that will anchor the network’s Frontier mainnet — but instead devolved into one of the most disorderly raise attempts of the year.\n",
      "The team said the execution “was sloppy” and that user expectations around a $250 million cap were not aligned with its internal goal of pre-seeding collateral to ensure 1:1 conversion at mainnet.\n",
      "All deposits will be refunded through a new smart contract that is currently under audit.\n",
      "While MegaETH emphasized that no funds were ever at risk, the decision follows a blow-by-blow breakdown shared by the team detailing how a series of small technical failures — compounded by operational missteps and misconfigured infrastructure — produced a chaotic, unfair sale process.\n",
      "The issues began immediately at launch, when transactions failed due to the contract containing an incorrect SaleUUID, necessitating a 4-of-6 multisig update.\n",
      "At the same time, Sonar, the KYC provider handling identity checks for deposits, applied an unexpectedly strict rate limit that blocked large portions of user traffic. It took the team more than twenty minutes to identify and fix the issue.\n",
      "Once the system resumed, deposits opened at a randomized time. Users who were refreshing the page managed to fill the entire $250 million cap within minutes, while those relying on official communications were effectively locked out.\n",
      "A decision was then made to raise the cap to $1 billion — but the transaction to lift the cap was executed roughly 30 minutes early by an external party.\n",
      "Because Safe multisig transactions become executable by anyone once the required signatures are met, the team lost control of the scheduled timing.\n",
      "Attempts to contain the inflow by lowering the cap to $400 million failed as inflows outpaced transaction confirmation. A second attempt at $500 million failed, but by then, the team had suspended the planned expansion to $1 billion and halted the entire process, citing unresolved bugs in the KYC flow.\n",
      "MegaETH stated that depositors will be recognized later, although it stopped short of specifying the details. As such, the USDm and the USDC to USDM conversion bridge will reopen ahead of the Frontier mainnet to build liquidity under a more controlled setup.\n",
      "The incident adds new pressure on MegaETH to prove the rest of its roadmap is production-ready.\n",

      "Bitcoin’s rebound above $90,000 is looking less like a crypto-driven surge and more like a classic year-end risk reset, according to market maker Flowdesk, which said in a recent note that short covering and dip buying have helped stabilize trading as expectations for a December rate cut surge.\n",
      "The broader market is pulling crypto along with it. QCP says inflation is still sticky, labor data is weakening, and credit risk is flashing in AI-linked equities, all of which could complicate the current relief rally.\n",
      "ETF outflows remain a headwind, and prediction markets show traders expect bitcoin to stay capped near $92,000 through the end of the month. With volatility crushed into the US holiday and desks focused on the 12 December FOMC, crypto is trading as a macro asset rather than on sector-specific news.\n",
      "Prediction markets reflect the same rangebound tone. Polymarket shows traders assigning a 74% probability that bitcoin’s weekly high will remain capped near $92,000 through the end of November.\n",
      "The odds of touching $96,000 or higher are in the single digits, which aligns with desk commentary that rallies into the mid $90,000s are likely to meet ETF-related supply.\n",
      "Support remains clustered in the $80,000 to $82,000 zone after last week’s washout, and crypto continues to trade as an expression of broader market risk appetite rather than on sector-specific news.\n",
      "Absent a shift in macro conditions, the path of least resistance is more sideways trading.\n",
      "BTC: Bitcoin is drifting in a tight band around the low $90,000s, with short covering lifting prices off last week’s lows while ETF outflows cap every attempt to push higher.\n",
      "ETH: Ether is hovering just above $3,000, attracting some dip buying but still struggling to build momentum after a month of heavier selling than bitcoin.\n",
      "Gold: Gold’s next leg higher is being fueled by falling rates, a weaker dollar, rising uncertainty and fading enthusiasm for AI and crypto, and Wells Fargo’s Sameer Samana telling Kitco News the uptrend remains intact as investors turn to gold as a key diversifier, with prices now consolidating around $4,150 to $4,170 after a failed push above $4,160 while expectations for a December Fed cut and persistent geopolitical tension keep the broader path tilted upward.\n",
      "Nikkei 225: Asia-Pacific markets traded mixed Friday as flat U.S. futures kept the Nasdaq on track to break its seven-month winning streak, with traders parsing Tokyo inflation above the Bank of Japan’s 2% target and the Nikkei 225 slipping 0.19% ahead of India’s GDP data.\n",
