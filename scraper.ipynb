      "Following a £30bn raid in this year’s Budget, Rachel Reeves has refused to rule out the possibility of introducing more tax rises next year. The Chancellor, who has been accused by the Tories of breaking Labour’s manifesto pledge not to put up taxes on working people, hinted there could be more to come in next year’s Budget.\n",
      "Many readers expressed outrage at Labour’s spending and asked whether any cuts had actually been made during her announcement on Wednesday. Genevieve Holl-Allen, The Telegraph’s political correspondent; Sam Brodbeck, our Money editor; Szu Ping Chan, our economics editor; and Camilla Tominey, an associate editor, joined you in the comments to discuss the political fallout.\n",
      "One reader, Rick Tuck, wondered about Reeves’s spending.\n",
      "He asked: “Has Reeves cut actual spending ANYWHERE?”\n",
      "Genevieve Holl-Allen said: “It is definitely true to say, Rick, that she has cut spending by even less than she said that she would – this is chiefly evident in welfare. Benefits spending will be £16bn a year higher in 2029 than planned, and the welfare bill is now expected to rise to £406.2bn in the next five years.\n",
      "“Rachel Reeves is keen to try and make efficiency savings in the public sector and hopes that AI might be able to save money too.\n",
      "“But she is desperate to not be accused of a return to austerity by voters and backbenchers. This means any big cuts in services appear a political impossibility for her.”\n",
      "Many readers, including Frank Johnson, questioned what exactly the Chancellor thought would help working people and the middle classes in Wednesday’s Budget.\n",
      "He said: “So, she’s going to put money in our pockets – but we all have to pay more. How does that make us better off?”\n",
      "Sam Brodbeck said: “You make a good point Frank! I’m not sure anyone will feel better off (apart from people with more than three kids who are on benefits perhaps). We got confirmation the triple lock will boost state pensions by around £550 a year but more of that boost will be lost to income tax.”\n",
      "Reeves mentioned Liz Truss more than once during her Budget speech and Richard O’Brien wondered how much longer they could refer to her tenure.\n",
      "He said: “Hiya, Sam, Labour keep blaming Liz Truss. Given that 90pc of her mini-Budget was reversed, does this not seem to be somewhat of a poor excuse for the Government to use?”\n",
      "Sam Brodbeck said: “Yes I noticed this ... I think she was mentioned three times yesterday. It is a poor excuse but any party other than the Tories will mention her tenure as much as possible for the next decade I imagine!”\n",
      "Mark Time questioned the Chancellor’s economics.\n",
      "He said: “I wonder what economic principles [Reeves] is using where she is fast losing control of inflation and so she taxes savings to increase minimum wages, and welfare payments to ensure the welfare lifestyle is viable?”\n",
      "Szu Ping Chan said: “It’s ideology. On the minimum wage, for example, Labour keeps coming back to the same old arguments. People who were bleating in 1999 about its introduction were wrong. People who were bleating when George Osborne upgraded it were wrong. But this time is different. Paying a teenager the same rate as someone in their late twenties is just a recipe for youth unemployment. Meanwhile, the inflation gremlin gets us all.”\n",
      "Reader Humpty Dumpty suggested Reeves is making it up as she goes along.\n",
      "They said: “She has ‘gambled’ on a better-than-currently-predicted economic outcome over the next five years, and has attempted to create the ‘headroom’ to allow cuts prior to the next election (without this the Labour Party are ‘doomed, I say doomed’!).\n",
      "“If, however, things are as bad as predicted, then she has taxed us (in her mind) correctly. I think she will continue to ‘make it up as she goes along’ while the party tolerates her in the job!”\n",
      "Szu Ping Chan replied: “Gamble is the right word. Richard Hughes, the boss of the OBR, said this morning that there wasn’t a single measure in this Budget that was likely to move the dial on growth. Headroom of £22bn is still wafer-thin for a £3trn economy. She talks the talk, but when it comes to walking the walk, I feel like things are going in reverse.”\n",
      "Labour backbenchers have been vociferous in their opposition to some of Reeves’s policy proposals and readers like Dylan Ratcliffe wondered how much pressure she is under.\n",
      "He asked: “Not that it matters, but do we think Reeves is making such decisions because she wants to, or because she’s been hustled into it by her backbenchers?”\n",
      "Genevieve Holl-Allen said: “A pretty inescapable conclusion from this Budget, Dylan, is that one of the bigger spending measures announced came from sustained backbench pressure: the scrapping of the two-child benefit cap.\n",
      "“There has been a clamour from Labour backbenchers to remove this limit pretty much since Labour took office.\n",
      "“Reeves and Starmer were standing firm on this, trying to show that they were strong on the economy and could not be cowed into making decisions they couldn’t pay for.\n",
      "“But as the Government has grown weaker and more unpopular, the Chancellor and PM have had to work a bit harder to keep those backbenchers on side, especially when major figures like deputy Labour leader Lucy Powell, and once-mooted leadership challenger Andy Burnham, have made it clear it must go as soon as possible.\n",
      "“And even those sympathetic to Labour are saying that the rises in tax are to pay for welfare. Benefits spending will be £16bn a year higher in 2029 than the Chancellor had planned in the spring.”\n",
      "Reader Sarwan Singh wondered how long Reeves and Starmer can last after this Budget.\n",
      "They asked: “The litmus test of this Budget is if Reeves and Starmer can last longer than Truss and kamikaze Kwarteng … and how the bond and gilt markets react. Can they last longer than a lettuce?”\n",
      "Genevieve Holl-Allen replied: “One of the problems that Reeves and the Government has faced over the last few weeks is all the leaks, which the deputy speaker yesterday said were the worst of any previous Budget.\n",
      "“But what this does mean is that the markets (and the public) have known a great deal about what to expect from the Chancellor, unlike the big shock of the mini-Budget with its £45bn of tax cuts. That has meant a slightly less dramatic response than in September 2022.\n",
      "“The Chancellor and the Prime Minister may last longer than a lettuce, but they certainly aren’t out of the woods.”\n",
      "Labour has changed its mind over many policies and readers like Mel Shaw wondering what the plan exactly is.\n",
      "They said: “What is the plan? Reeves must think she has one. Can anyone work out what it is?”\n",
      "Genevieve Holl-Allen said: “I was struck by something that George Osborne, the former Tory chancellor, said on his Political Currency podcast last night, which is that this Budget was an ‘off-strategy’ fiscal event for Reeves, and I think he’s right.\n",
      "“The Chancellor at the previous Budget had said that she would not be coming back for more tax, and even said that she would not continue the freeze in income tax thresholds as it would ‘hurt working people’. But she isn’t getting the growth she wanted, and the welfare reforms she wanted to see through were scuppered by her backbenchers, so she had to find another path.\n",
      "“It does seem that her plan with this Budget now is to create as much headroom as possible, of around £22bn by the end of the current Parliament, so that she has a bigger buffer zone to changing fiscal forecasts.”\n",
      "Readers like Phillip Norris also asked why Reeves refuses to take accountability.\n",
      "He said: “I just love the spin given by her: the tax free amount was frozen by the Conservatives until 2028 — as though it was a very bad thing — then next breath she increases it by three years to 2031!\n",
      "“The blame game began in earnest as soon as she could mention it. So the whole problem is Trump, Truss, Brexit, Reform and Uncle Tom Cobley and all. Anyone, anything other than themselves, because it would mean they would need to take responsibility and accountability.”\n",
      "Genevieve Holl-Allen replied: “Rachel Reeves has continued to point back to the previous 14 years of Conservative government, in particular Liz Truss’s mini-Budget and the handling of Brexit, to explain Britain’s current financial woes.\n",
      "“That rhetoric is likely to have helped them win the general election, with voters fed up with the Tories, but you have to wonder how much more patience the electorate will have if they continue to see their finances stretched and their taxes high after many months of a Labour administration.\n",
      "“The 2026 local elections and elections in Holyrood and the Senedd might give us the answer.”\n",
      "James Turner asked if the Chancellor is aware that she has broken her manifesto pledge.\n",
      "He said: “I’m surprised that nobody has pointed out to Reeves that she has raised tax rates – on savings interest, property income, and dividends.”\n",
      "Camilla Tominey replied: “The Telegraph has pointed that out loudly and clearly.\n",
      "“The figures are clear: £26bn of extra taxes, with the tax take up to 42.4 as a percentage of GDP after the end of this parliament. There is no other way to say it: she’s taxing working people to pay for new benefits plus an inflation-linked welfare hike. It’s a clear manifesto breach.”\n",
      "Phillip Marques questioned when the Government will cease borrowing and begin addressing the national debt.\n",
      "He said: “This Government did not mention anything about reducing the £2.6tn deficit we have. Do you think they will actually start paying the debt down anytime soon rather than keep borrowing massively?”\n",
      "Camilla Tominey said: “Rachel Reeves said yesterday: ‘The path of our deficit reduction remains broadly the same as in spring.’\n",
      "“Back then, she announced we would be moving from a deficit of £36.1bn in 2025-26 and £13.4bn in 2026-27 ... to a surplus of £6.0bn in 2027-28, £7.1bn in 2028-29, and a surplus of £9.9bn in 2029-30. She said: ‘That means that we are continuing to meet the Stability Rule two years early.’\n",
      "“But debt is a different thing. It’s way too high but it will come down slightly by the end of the parliament. It’s forecast to be 83.3pc in 26/27, 83.6pc in 27/28, 83.7pc in 28/29…falling to 83.0pc in 29/30 and 82.2pc in 30/31.\n",
      "“NB Debt on this scale is completely unsustainable. It was below 40 as a pc of GDP from 1993 to 2008 when it shot up – and now remains at more than double what it was.”\n",

      "VC Kara Nortman bet early on women’s sports, and now she’s creating the market\n",
      "TechCrunch \n",
      "No tickers found\n",
      "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vc-kara-nortman-bet-early-061751354.html\n",
      "Connie Loizos\n",
      "Sat, November 29, 2025 at 1:17 PM GMT+7\n",
      "When its season ended early this month, Angel City FC finished 11th out of 13 teams, a disappointing result for the Los Angeles soccer franchise that venture capitalist Kara Nortman co-founded in 2020. But the season’s struggles tell only part of a much larger story that’s reshaping how investors think about women’s sports.\n",
      "Despite its lackluster on-field performance, Angel City itself has become a case study (including literally, inside Harvard Business School) in how to best construct a women’s sports property. The team’s celebrity ownership group, including Natalie Portman and Serena Williams, has helped generate nearly unprecedented buzz. The franchise has also been savvy about sponsorships, breaking records before players kicked a ball.\n",
      "“We went from zero to $30 million in revenue. We sold out games. We built something people didn’t think was possible,” Nortman reflected in an interview last month, pointing to Angel City’s commercial success from the very outset of the team’s formation. “That really led to the formation of Monarch.”\n",
      "That commercial success, not trophies, became the blueprint for Monarch Collective, the $250 million fund Nortman launched in 2023, which has become the first investment vehicle focused exclusively on women’s sports. While its origin story may be rooted in a team that has yet to win a playoff game, Monarch’s portfolio and influence have expanded far beyond Angel City’s training facility in Thousand Oaks, California.\n",
      "The fund now holds stakes in three other National Women’s Soccer League clubs: San Diego Wave, Boston Legacy FC (debuting next year), and its newest investment, announced earlier this month, FC Viktoria Berlin. The deal for 38% of the German club, makes Monarch the first foreign investor to acquire a stake in a German women’s soccer team.\n",
      "It’s a diverse collection that reflects Nortman’s conviction that women’s sports have reached an inflection point, regardless of any single team’s fortunes. The numbers support her optimism, too.\n",
      "“The overall men’s sports market globally is estimated to be about half a trillion dollars,” Nortman explains. “The women’s sports market, when we started Monarch in 2023, was thought to be about half a billion dollars. It’s now closer to $3 billion.”\n",
      "Tapping into that growth requires a different playbook than men’s sports, Nortman says. It’s not a simple rinse-and-repeat. “Like, how many men’s team owners are thinking about parachuting Sephora boxes from rafters? Or having at [a New York] Liberty [WNBA game] a Fenty cam for putting on your [Fenty] lipstick, or Angel City having a Hello Kitty collab night where people can’t figure out how to get their hands on the merch before it sells out?”\n",
      "Angel City’s innovative approach to marketing and partnerships helped it build so much excitement that in the fall of last year, power couple Bob Iger and Willow Bay acquired a majority stake in it for $250 million, making it the most valuable women’s sports franchise in the world.\n",
      "For Nortman, who left Upfront Ventures and more traditional venture capital to focus full-time on women’s sports, Angel City’s commercial achievements have continued to validate Monarch’s thesis. Though there’s current tension – certainly in the sports press, at least – between Angel City’s business success and its on-field performance, the team has inarguably proven that women’s sports can generate serious revenue with the right pieces in place.\n",
      "Now, as with any successful new endeavor, the question is: can the momentum last? Nortman is acutely aware that women’s sports has seen promising moments evaporate before. She frequently references a striking historical parallel from 1920, when 60,000 people showed up in Liverpool, England, to watch the Dick, Kerr Ladies play football, which is a bigger crowd than most Premier League games draw today. The next year, the English Football Association banned women from playing, and the sport essentially disappeared for decades.\n",
      "“Everyone gets to wake up and become the discoverer of women’s sports when they do,” Nortman says. “But it takes consistent, hard work to get that to play out into consistency.”\n",
      "That hard work, she argues, requires more than just riding waves of attention from breakout stars like Caitlin Clark or Angel Reese. It demands systematic investment in infrastructure, governance, and operations – the unglamorous work of building sustainable businesses.\n",
      "This is where Monarch’s approach diverges from typical venture capital. Rather than making passive bets on dozens of startups, Monarch is taking concentrated positions in a handful of teams and leagues, then getting deeply involved in operations. The fund describes its strategy as “venture-like markets” with “growth equity or private equity-like” risk management.\n",
      "“We show up alongside control owners and add a lot of operational value,” Nortman explains. The goal is to help teams reach breakeven or profitability on their core operations, positioning them to benefit as higher-margin media revenue grows.\n",
      "Monarch’s investment interest extend beyond soccer. The fund is more broadly focused on what Nortman calls sports with “no product-market risk,” meaning established formats with proven audiences.\n",
      "“Is this a sport people like to watch on their computer or television?” she asks. “There are participatory sports, like pickleball, but are people going to sit home and create an event out of watching it?”\n",
      "Indeed, while Monarch has stakes right now in four “football” clubs, it’s interested, too, in women’s basketball, golf, and tennis – sports with substantial media revenue potential, along with existing infrastructure.\n",
      "The firm’s current limited partners include Melinda French Gates, former Netflix executives, and other wealthy individuals, and interest in its mission seems to be growing. For one thing, Monarch’s debut fund of $250 million is substantially more than the $100 million that Nortman and her co-founder – Jasmine Robinson, a former investor with the sports-, media-, gaming-, and fitness-focused growth stage firm Causeway – initially planned to raise. She says the increased size reflects the market’s rapid maturation during Monarch’s fundraising period.\n",
      "“When we started raising the fund, nine out of 10 conversations were, ‘Yeah, we don’t think [women’s] basketball is really a thing,'” Nortman says, recalling a “lot of skepticism around it.” Then came Caitlin Clark’s meteoric rise, the WNBA’s record-breaking viewership, and suddenly basketball became the hottest sector in women’s sports.\n",
      "That growing interest validates Nortman’s thesis that women’s sports investment isn’t about finding the single perfect team but about supporting an ecosystem where multiple franchises can thrive. Some will win championships. Some will struggle competitively but succeed commercially. The key is having enough capital and operational expertise distributed across the market to weather individual setbacks.\n",
      "Already, Angel City appears to be inspiring other ownership groups. “You started having other teams – Kansas City, Bay FC, Washington D.C. Spirit – with female-led ownership groups come in and show they could build a real P&L,” Nortman notes. Whether intentionally or not, Angel City became a template.\n",
      "As women’s sports enters what feels like a sustained boom period — the Golden State Valkyries just played their first WNBA next season, the NWSL is expanding, media rights deals are growing — Nortman remains cautiously optimistic about whether this moment will prove different from past surges in interest.\n",
      "The key, she argues, lies in the fundamentals: strong league governance, owner commitment, infrastructure investment, and building genuine community connections. Media attention creates opportunity; operational excellence makes it sustainable.\n",
      "“Every spike is an opportunity to create a consistent experience around it,” Nortman says. “You have to look at all the underlying criteria to see where it’s likely to stick around.”\n",

      "Sat, November 29, 2025 at 1:00 PM GMT+7\n",
      "The European Commission has been under pressure to secure long-term financing for Kyiv. Its most likely option — a €140bn “reparation loan” backed by immobilised Russian state assets — has drawn criticism from Euroclear, the main custodian of the funds.\n",
      "According to the Financial Times, Euroclear chief executive Valérie Urbain warned in a letter that “the resultant risk premium will lead to a sustained increase in European sovereign bond spreads, raising borrowing costs for all member states”.\n",
      "The concern centres on whether investors view the scheme as amounting to confiscation, which is prohibited under international law. Any perception that foreign reserves held in Europe could be at risk might undermine trust in European financial systems, driving up bond yields.\n",
      "Yet analysts interviewed by Euronews Business say the current proposal carries far less risk than the EU’s original move in 2022 to freeze Russian central-bank assets — an action that caused only a brief shift in bond markets.\n",
      "Robert Timper, chief strategist on the Global Fixed Income Strategy team at BCA Research, said: “I don’t expect much of a market reaction to this, so there won’t be any cost to governments in terms of a higher debt service cost.”\n",
      "He continued: “The immobilisation of Russian assets in 2022 was a first and is what mattered for asset owners, as it meant that they lost access to these assets”. He claimed: “What ultimately is done with these assets should have a much smaller effect.”\n",
      "The EU froze billions of euros of Russian assets on 28 February 2022, four days after Moscow launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine.\n",
      "Nicolas Véron, senior fellow at the Brussels-based think tank Bruegel, said: “It was a constraint put on the Russian reserves and therefore a demonstration to the world that, given the circumstances, the EU was willing to put big constraints on reserves held on its territory.” He added: “That didn't rock global markets.”\n",
      "Capital Economics similarly argued that fears of a broad retreat by foreign central banks or sovereign wealth funds from European markets are overstated. “Even if there is some loss of confidence, the impact would likely be small as there is a limited range of liquid, high-quality assets that central banks can invest in outside Western financial markets,” it wrote in a recent report.\n",
      "Concerning the shifting trends in the bond market, Timper added that since the immobilisation of the Russian assets in 2022, “we have observed a broad shift by central banks, especially in China and emerging markets, to gold as a reserve asset. This trend is likely to continue, but was already underway before the recent discussions around the use of Russian assets.” He expects this diversification trend to continue but added that so far this “has had little effect on sovereign bonds”.\n",

      "EU should stop discussing and move forward with Ukraine reparations loan, Dombrovskis tells Euronews\n",
      "What is the reparations loan for Ukraine and why is the EU stuck with the plan?\n",
      "While the details haven’t been released, Capital Economics said in their report that Euroclear would use the cash it holds on behalf of the Russian Central Bank (CBR) to invest in a long-dated, zero-coupon EU bond. Euroclear’s assets would change from cash balances to an EU bond, but its liability to the CBR would remain unchanged. This is key to holding up the law, which prohibits confiscation.\n",
      "The proceeds from the bond would then be used by the EU to lend to Ukraine.\n",
      "As Euronews reported earlier, Ukraine would be asked to repay the loan only after Russia ends its war of aggression and agrees to compensate for the damages caused. After that, the Commission would repay Euroclear, and Euroclear would repay Russia, completing the circle. The Commission insists this is not confiscation.\n",
      "The loan would be guaranteed by the participating member states, who step in if there is not sufficient reimbursement of the loan. According to the current plans, Russia would be able to recover the assets if it agreed to pay reparations, but that is seen as virtually impossible.\n",
      "CEO of Euroclear Valérie Urbain said in her letter that forcing Euroclear to invest in “zero-interest tailored-debt instrument funding” in order to enact the scheme would be seen as confiscation by Russia, leading to retaliation and potential legal challenges that Euroclear should be covered for.\n",
      "Bruegel's Véron agreed that the main threat comes from Russia’s response: “This is not a confiscation… but there will be Russian propaganda saying it is a confiscation.” He added: “It's not outlandish to imagine that if the reparations loan is decided, Russia will do something that may be detrimental to the global markets.”\n",
      "Capital Economics also cautioned that tit-for-tat measures could carry economic costs, noting that Moscow has already complicated Western companies’ efforts to exit the Russian market.\n",

      "The Commission meanwhile, faces mounting pressure to outline its plan, particularly as a current US peace proposal suggests the Russian assets should be used to establish US-led investment funds in Ukraine and Russia.\n",
      "In an interview with Europe Today, European commissioner for economy and productivity Valdis Dombrovskis said a reparation loan backed by frozen Russian assets is “what can provide sizeable support for Ukraine without putting additional and substantial fiscal burden on the EU or its member states”.\n",
      "Véron expects the plan to be finalised by the end of the year, with disbursements potentially starting in the first quarter of 2026, pending parliamentary approvals in several member states.\n",
      "Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has said the funds are needed in 2026, ideally “at the very beginning of the year”.\n",

      "The financing ultimately depends on political agreement. Ukraine needs stable, multi-year support to maintain its defence effort, but many EU states are constrained by high debt levels.

      "Ryanair has scrapped a VIP loyalty scheme offering ticket discounts after members booked too many cheap flights.\n",
      "On Friday, the low-cost airline said it was ending its “Prime” membership programme after just eight months because a surge of bookings had led to €1.6m (£1.4m) of losses.\n",
      "Under the plan, members could pay £79 a year and get monthly discounts of up to £60 off return flights, as well as free travel insurance and seat reservations.\n",
      "However, Ryanair said the trial programme had “cost more money than it generated” with subscription fees bringing in €4.4m but members receiving more than €6m in discounts.\n",
      "The scheme will be closed to new members with immediate effect before shutting down completely next October.\n",
      "Dara Brady, Ryanair’s marketing chief, said that while 55,000 people had signed up, at least two million members would have been needed to make it a success.\n",
      "“Generally with these programmes, if someone takes the full value of everything it will end up costing you money no matter who you are,” he said.\n",
      "“We gave it a go. It was just about washing its face but there wasn’t much in it for us. We needed it to be much higher volume.\n",
      "“It took more effort than it was worth. You needed to manage monthly fares and the comms schedule and monitor the system to make sure people were getting their allocations. It was a lot of work for a very small proportion of our passengers.”\n",
      "Mr Brady said Ryanair could have worked to lift membership towards 200,000 to generate more fees – but this would still have been “small beans” at an airline carrying 200 million people a year and generating €13bn in revenue.\n",
      "The marketing chief said the initiative had been well intentioned and was created after passengers had pressed it for a membership scheme.\n",
      "However, he said the outcome of the experiment suggested loyalty schemes were better suited to the full-service, long-haul carriers such as British Airways.\n",
      "“There were some great bargains. But people who are travelling once or twice a year are not going to sign up and someone flying from Manchester back to Dublin every month already knows the drill,” he said.\n",
      "“They say, ‘Look, I get the low fares anyway and I’ll decide at the time whether I’m taking a reserved seat and insurance. I’m not deciding now for the next 12 months.’\n",
      "“Loyalty programmes work better on long-haul, premium routes, which we don’t do. In the low-cost market, what drives loyalty is price. If we drop fares we get the customers anyway.\n",
      "“There are better things to pour our time into, like our regular seat sales and buy one get one free offers that are open to everybody.”\n",

      "SELLO MOTSETA and FARAI MUTSAKA\n",
      "Sat, November 29, 2025 at 11:05 AM GMT+7\n",
      "GABORONE, Botswana (AP) — In a village outside Botswana ’s capital, Keorapetse Koko sat on an aging couch in her sparsely furnished home, stunned that a career — and an entire nation’s economy — built on diamonds had fallen so far, so fast.\n",
      "For 17 years, she had earned a living cutting and polishing the gems that helped transform Botswana from one of the world’s poorest nations into one of Africa’s success stories. Diamonds were discovered in 1967, a year after independence, an abrupt change of fortune for the landlocked country.\n",
      "Botswana became the world’s top diamond producer by value, and second-largest by volume after Russia. Diamonds are woven into the national identity, with local Olympic champion runner Letsile Tebogo heading a De Beers campaign celebrating how the industry funds schools and stadiums.\n",
      "The stones that Koko and thousands of others dug and polished over the decades have funded Botswana’s health, education, infrastructure and more. The country risked the “resource curse” of building its economy on a single natural asset — and unlike many African nations, it was a success.\n",
      "But Koko lost her job a year ago, joining many others left adrift as Africa’s trade in natural diamonds buckles under growing pressure from cheaper lab-grown diamonds mass-produced mainly in China and India.\n",
      "“I have debts and I don’t know how I am going to pay them,” said the mother of two, who had survived on about $300 a month and relied on her employer for medical insurance. It had been a decent situation for a semi-skilled worker in a country where the average monthly salary is about $500. “Every month they call me asking for money. But where do I get it?”\n",
      "‘Diamonds built our country’\n",
      "Botswana, which has unearthed some of the world’s biggest stones, has prided itself on prudently managing its natural wealth, avoiding the corruption and fighting that have plagued many African peers. Its marketing message has been simple: Its stones are conflict-free and help fund development.\n",
      "“Diamonds built our country,” said Joseph Tsimako, president of the Botswana Mine Workers Union, which represents about 10,000 workers in the nation of 2.5 million people. “Now, as the world changes, we must find a way to make sure they don’t destroy the lives of the people who helped build it.”\n",
      "He warned that new U.S. tariffs under the Trump administration could worsen Botswana’s downturn, triggering staffing freezes, unpaid leave and more layoffs. The U.S. has imposed a 15% tariff on diamonds that are mined, cut and polished there.\n",
      "Diamond exports, roughly 80% of Botswana’s foreign earnings and a third of government revenue, have tumbled.\n",
      "Debswana, the largest local diamond producer and a joint venture between the government and mining giant De Beers, saw revenues halve last year. It has paused operations at some mines as Botswana and Angola enter talks to take over controlling stakes in De Beers’ diamond mining unit.\n",
      "In September, Botswana’s national statistics agency reported a 43% drop in diamond output in the second quarter, the steepest fall in the country’s modern mining history. The World Bank expects the economy to shrink 3% this year, the second consecutive contraction.\n",
      "The rise of synthetic diamonds\n",
      "The global rise of synthetic diamonds has been swift. They have “given stiff competition, especially in lower-quality stones,” said Siddarth Gothi, chairman of the Botswana Diamond Manufacturers Association.\n",
      "The gems emerged in the 1950s for industrial use. By the 1970s they had reached jewelry quality. Lab-grown stones now sell for up to 80% less than natural diamonds. Once making up just 1% of global sales in 2015, they have surged to nearly 20%.\n",
      "Glitzy social media videos have fueled the appeal of synthetic gems made in weeks under intense heat and pressure and marketed as cheaper, conflict-free and eco-friendly alternatives to stones formed over billions of years.\n",
      "Environmental groups have said natural diamond mining can drive deforestation, destroy habitats, degrade the soil and pollute the water. But environmental claims about the synthetic gems also face scrutiny, with critics noting that production remains energy-intensive, often powered by fossil fuels.\n",
      "From “a marginal phenomenon,” an “unprecedented flood” of synthetics now threatens the natural diamond’s value and future, World Federation of Diamond Bourses president Yoram Dvash warned in July.\n",
      "Lab-grown stones now account for most new U.S. engagement rings, he said. Natural diamond prices have fallen roughly 30% since 2022, leaving the industry at what Dvash called “a critical juncture.”\n",
      "Hollywood stars, including Billie Eilish and Pamela Anderson, and Bollywood celebrities have boosted synthetic diamonds’ allure, along with Gen Z influencers.\n",
      "“The new generation of youngsters getting engaged, they’ve got far more important things to spend their money on than a diamond,” said Ian Furman, founder of Naturally Diamonds, which sells natural and synthetic diamonds in neighboring South Africa. “So, it’s become so attractive to them to buy lab diamonds.\"\n",
      "Furman said that for every 100 diamonds his company sells, around 95 are synthetic when just five or six years ago it was overwhelmingly natural diamonds.\n",
      "African producers feel the pain\n",
      "The shift is felt beyond Botswana. Across southern Africa, falling production of natural diamonds and revenue have led to job cuts and financial strain.\n",
      "To counter the trend, Botswana, Angola, Namibia, South Africa and Congo in June agreed to pool 1% of annual diamond revenues, translating into millions of dollars, into a global marketing push led by the Natural Diamond Council to promote natural stones. The nonprofit’s members include major mining companies such as De Beers Group and Rio Tinto, which have invested heavily in natural diamonds.\n",
      "Last year, the council launched a “Real. Rare. Responsible” campaign starring actor Lily James in a bid to recast natural diamonds as unique and ethically sourced.\n",
      "Kristina Buckley Kayel, the council’s managing director for North America, said restoring natural diamonds’ “desirability” is essential to protect producer economies, particularly in southern Africa.\n",
      "With its diamond income no longer assured, Botswana’s government in September created a sovereign wealth fund focused on investment and diversification beyond mining, although details about its value and investors sketchy. Suddenly, the country’s elephant-heavy tourism industry and other mining options, including gold, silver and uranium, are more important than ever.\n",
      "But for Koko, the laid-off diamond worker, the policy shift may have come too late.\n",
      "“I was the breadwinner in a big family,” she said. “Now I don’t even know how to feed my own. Looking for another job is very difficult. The skills I learned are only relevant to the diamond industry.”\n",
      "She never owned a diamond herself. Even the smallest would be a luxury beyond her means.\n",

      "Sat, November 29, 2025 at 10:41 AM GMT+7\n",
      "Ted and Jamie Garber own 28 rental units in Florida, focusing on cash flow and ROI.\n",
      "They started investing in 2020 to create an additional revenue stream.\n",
      "They're looking for undervalued properties in their market that satisfy the 1% rule.\n",
      "Ted and Jamie Garber, two real estate investors, have specific cash flow and ROI goals for each of their rental properties.\n",
      "\"Each rental needs to shed cash flow immediately and, on average, pay back our initial investment within three to six years,\" Ted told Business Insider, adding that they treat each unit as if it's its own miniature business.\n",
      "The Florida couple started buying rentals in 2020 to create an additional revenue stream and accelerate their progress toward financial independence. As of 2025, they own 28 units across 15 commercial and residential properties, which BI confirmed through the Brevard County Property Appraiser.\n",
      "Their average cash-on-cash return is just north of 20%, Ted said.\n",
      "To guarantee immediate cash flow, they've narrowed down their \"buy box\" — the set of criteria they've established that they want to see in a property before purchasing. Here's exactly what they're looking for.\n",
      "1. Properties in their backyard. The Garbers, who live on the east coast of Florida in Brevard County, like to keep their investment properties close to home — at least for now.\n",
      "\"We're still focused on our backyard. It's still appreciating. It's still in high demand,\" said Ted, who manages each of their 15 properties. While they'd eventually like to expand to different markets, there is enough opportunity on the Space Coast to keep them busy in the near future.\n",
      "2. Affordability. \"Our buy box is affordable housing — not low, not high — something that just the everyday person can rent,\" Ted said, adding that they prefer to rent at or below market rates. \"That allows us to get a lot of applications to really be able to pick and choose our tenants. And, our tenants value the fact that they're renting slightly below market rate, so they're going to want to take care of the place. They're getting a deal, and we're still making money from it all.\"\n",
      "3. Undervalued properties. One of the reasons the couple can offer at or below market rent is because they won't purchase unless they've secured an excellent deal. They subscribe to the principle that \"you make money on the buy,\" Ted said.\n",
      "To find undervalued properties or negotiable deals, \"we would look for things that had been sitting for a while — maybe the marketing wasn't very good or it needed a cosmetic renovation,\" Jamie said.\n",
      "Ted added that they're not looking for a major renovation project: \"Part of the buy box is looking for smaller lift, value-add things like paint and floors. We also look for listings that don't have the best pictures and aren't marketed correctly.\"\n",
      "The Garbers constantly look at listings in their area. When they come across something in their buy box, the next step is to see whether the property will satisfy the \"1% rule.\"\n",
      "This general rule of thumb suggests that to create positive cash flow, the monthly rent of your property should be at least 1% of the purchase price.\n",
      "\"So, if you're looking at a condo that is $120,000, you need to be able to rent it for $1,200 a month,\" Ted said, noting that it's become more difficult in the past couple of years to satisfy this rule with rising interest rates, insurance rates, and condo fees. They'd ideally have a buffer: For example, renting a $120,000 condo for $1,500 a month.\n",
      "They have the advantage of already owning several long-term rentals and understanding typical rental rates in their area, but you can use tools like Zillow to get a feel for rent in your market.\n",
      "While their main focus is on cash flow, they're reaping more benefits from owning real estate.\n",
      "\"There's appreciation — adding to your net worth and your end goal; depreciation, so the ability to offset your income and your taxes; and then another main benefit is that your tenants are paying off your mortgage for you,\" Ted said.\n",
      "\"If we factor in all those other things, we're at more than a 30% return on investment throughout the portfolio.\"\n",

      "American shoppers are delivering a record-breaking Black Friday, with online spending already reaching $8.6 billion by early evening and projections suggesting the final tally could exceed initial forecasts, according to data from Adobe Analytics.\n",
      "Black Friday online spending through 6:30 p.m. ET represents 9.4% growth compared to last year, slightly outpacing Adobe's earlier forecast of 8.3% growth for the day.\n",
      "Adobe now expects consumers will spend between $11.7 billion and $11.9 billion by the time Black Friday concludes, up from its earlier projection of $11.7 billion. This would set a new single-day record for online shopping. Adobe also found that more buyers are turning to AI tools and Buy Now Pay Later options to make purchases.\n",
      "The data comes from analyzing commerce transactions across over 1 trillion visits to US retail sites, covering 100 million products across 18 categories.\n",
      "\"Adobe surveyed over 1,000 US consumers and nearly half believe the best deals this season will come on Black Friday, pushing many to hit buy on products before Cyber Monday,\" said Vivek Pandya, lead analyst at Adobe Digital Insights, in a statement. \"Given the strong spending so far today, we anticipate the final tally for online shopping on Black Friday will exceed our initial forecast.\"\n",
      "The strong Black Friday performance sets the stage for what Adobe expects to be a robust Cyber Week, the five-day period spanning Thanksgiving through Cyber Monday. The company forecasts that period will account for 17.2% of the entire holiday season's spending, totaling $43.7 billion, up 6.3% from last year.\n",
      "The hottest sellers so far include televisions, the newly released Nintendo Switch 2, Apple AirPods 4, and the Oura Ring 4.

      "The surge in spending has been fueled by discounts that ran deeper than analysts initially anticipated. Electronics saw the steepest markdowns at up to 29% off list prices, followed by toys at 28%, apparel at 25%, and televisions at 24%. Computers, appliances, furniture, and sporting goods all saw significant price cuts ranging from 19% to 23% off.\n",
      "Shoppers are increasingly turning to artificial intelligence for help navigating deals and finding the right products. AI-driven traffic to retail sites, measured by shoppers clicking on links from AI assistants, is expected to surge 600% compared to last year.\n",
      "In Adobe's survey, nearly half of respondents said they have used or plan to use AI for online shopping this season, primarily for finding deals, conducting product research, and getting recommendations.\n",
      "The growing reliance on AI shopping tools comes as companies race to integrate the technology into the holiday shopping experience. Earlier this week, OpenAI introduced a shopping research feature in ChatGPT that builds personalized buyer's guides by asking clarifying questions and surfacing information from across the web.\n",
      "Mobile shopping continued its dominance, accounting for 58.6% of online sales so far and driving $5.1 billion in spending, a 11.3% year-over-year increase. That represents a higher mobile share than last year's Black Friday, when phones and tablets accounted for 55% of purchases.\n",
      "Buy Now Pay Later (BNPL) services also experienced heightened activity, with the payment option expected to drive $761.8 million in Black Friday spending, representing an 11% increase from the previous year.\n",
      "The vast majority of these installment purchases happen on mobile devices, which account for 82.4% of BNPL transactions this holiday season. Consumers are most likely to use the payment option for electronics, apparel, toys, and furniture.\n",

      "Based on consensus among 24 analysts, Coca-Cola stock has an average Strong Buy rating with a near-perfect score of 4.75 out of 5. The score was relatively stable over the last 3 months - or perhaps, even years. The high target for Coca-Cola is $85 per share, which translates to an upside of 17% from current levels.\n",
      "Finally, the last Dividend King on my list is Johnson & Johnson, a healthcare giant that operates in several segments, including pharmaceuticals, medical devices, and consumer health products. Johnson & Johnson also develops treatments for complicated health conditions.\n",
      "Today, JNJ stock trades at about $207 per share and has gained ~38% over the past 5 years. Not overly explosive, but the stock is certainly stable, with a 60-month beta of just 0.38.\n",
      "Payout-wise, Johnson & Johnson pays a quarterly dividend of $1.30, which translates to a forward annual dividend $5.20 per share, translating to a yield of about 2.6%. The payout ratio is also within a very acceptable range of 48.63%.\n",
      "The company’s most recent annual revenue increased 4.3% to $88.82 billion. Meanwhile, net income declined 60% to $14 billion, or $5.84 per basic share. However, investors need to remember that 2023's net income is inflated, as J&J recorded a one-time gain of roughly $21 billion from spinning off Kenvue, its Consumer Health segment. As a result, 2026's number should be normalized against this FY.\n",
      "Meanwhile, a consensus among 25 analysts points to a Moderate Buy rating with a score of 4.12 out of 5, and this has been gradually increasing in recent months. The high price target for JNJ is $230 per share, implying roughly 11% upside potential from where we are now.\n",
      "Mega-cap Dividend Kings are some of the safest options for a buy-and-forget strategy. For the companies mentioned above, the chance of them reaching zero is also almost zero. However, the market can do funny things. The smart money keeps on top of the news, watches the financials, and reinvests those dividends for explosive compound growth- especially if there are years before the income is ever needed.\n",

      "Sunday Robotics joins a growing field of startups creating advanced home robots.\n",
      "After Sunday Robotics emerged from stealth mode last week, it revealed a team stocked with Tesla alums.\n",
      "At least 10 former Tesla employees work at the robotics startup, including several longtime employees who were involved in Tesla's humanoid robot and self-driving efforts, according to a LinkedIn analysis.\n",
      "Perry Jia, who worked on Tesla's Autopilot and Optimus programs for nearly six years, announced last week that he'd left the electric-car maker during the summer to work at the startup.\n",
      "Nadeesha Amarasinghe also joined Sunday Robotics during the summer, his LinkedIn profile shows. He'd previously worked at Tesla for more than seven years, serving as an engineering lead for AI infrastructure, where he assisted with both Optimus and Autopilot.\n",
      "Tesla's Autopilot and Optimus programs are among the company's most high-profile efforts. Tesla CEO Elon Musk has said the carmaker's ability to solve autonomous driving will determine its long-term value. He has also placed a heavy emphasis on the Optimus humanoid robot, saying the company aims to eventually ship millions of units capable of tasks ranging from factory work to personal care.\n",
      "Sunday Robotics also has an array of former Tesla interns and Autopilot employees who have worked at Tesla over the past five years, including Jason Peterson, a former Optimus and robotaxi talent employee, according to his LinkedIn profile.\n",

      "Michael Burry has warned AI giants are overstating how long their Nvidia chips will stay relevant.\n",
      "Bridgewater's Greg Jensen said the chips may be used to invent better chips that make them obsolete.\n",
      "While Burry has warned about circular deals in AI, Jensen said Nvidia is building an ecosystem.\n",
      "Michael Burry of \"The Big Short\" fame has said some of the world's largest AI companies are exaggerating how long their Nvidia chips will last to pad their short-term profits. Now, one hedge fund boss has warned that those chips could make themselves obsolete.\n",
      "Greg Jensen, the co-chief investor of Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates, told the \"In Good Company\" podcast this week that the \"depreciation schedule is probably going to be quite fast, and you hope it has to be in a sense.\"\n",
      "Jensen explained there's a \"resource grab\" in AI as companies compete for scarce land, energy, microchips, and scientists, and tech bosses are hoping AI itself can help.\n",
      "\"One of the things they have to do is figure out how to make the chips more efficient, make the energy more efficient, and they're trying to use AI to do those things,\" he said.\n",
      "Jensen predicted that some of the scientific advances that will \"depreciate the current assets will come from those assets themselves,\" as \"AI will generate better ways to do this.\"\n",
      "Burry shot to fame after his massive bet against the US housing bubble was immortalized in the book \"The Big Short,\" and a movie adaptation starring actor Christian Bale as Burry.\n",
      "He resurfaced on X in late October after more than two years of silence. Since then, he has sounded the alarm on an AI bubble, closed his hedge fund to outside cash, launched a Substack to share his research, and disclosed he owns bearish put options on Nvidia and another AI darling, Palantir.\n",
      "Burry has taken aim at the AI giants for dragging out depreciation from around three years to six years or longer, pointing out that Nvidia is releasing new chips faster and faster, so the current generation will likely lose value more quickly.\n",
      "\"The hyperscalers have been systematically increasing the useful lives of chips and servers, for depreciation purposes, as they invest hundreds of billions of dollars in graphics chips with accelerating planned obsolescence,\" he wrote on Substack this week.\n",
      "The investor has also called out the sprawling web of \"give-and-take deals\" between AI companies.\n",
      "Jensen said those aren't a product of \"normal bubble dynamics\" — companies juicing their financials to justify their lofty valuations — as \"Nvidia can get as much revenue as it wants\" given the immense demand for its chips.\n",
      "Instead, Jensen said, Nvidia is scrambling to create its own ecosystem of buyers who won't develop their own chips, in an attempt to stop Alphabet from owning the entire AI \"stack.\"\n",
      "\"They're like Standard Oil in the Gilded Age, trying to create monopolistic control on things,\" Jensen said about Nvidia. He added that \"everybody's got to lock up who do I partner with, where am I going to get my chips and power — and if I don't do it, I'm going to die.\"\n",
      "Jensen also said the AI investment boom isn't a typical capital cycle, as bosses such as Elon Musk and Sam Altman believe they're in a race to develop a supreme intelligence, and are willing to spend whatever it takes to win.\n",

      "‘Working for tariffs’: A small Christmas supply firm in Utah is struggling with big bills\n",
      "NBC News \n",
      "No tickers found\n",
      "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/working-tariffs-small-christmas-supply-233109769.html\n",
      "Maya Huter\n",
      "Sat, November 29, 2025 at 6:31 AM GMT+7\n",
      "This holiday season, tariffs are threatening the survival of a small Christmas supply business outside of Salt Lake City.\n",
      "Jared and Dawnita Hendricks have owned Village Lighting for 23 years, selling and distributing a variety of Christmas products to big box stores and directly to consumers online. The company currently employs 15 people.\n",
      "But when Village Lighting's 2025 holiday season garlands, wreaths, lights and decor arrived by ship at U.S. ports from Asia in recent months, many of them carried additional tariff costs of up to 50% per item.\n",
      "These added fees are the result of President Donald Trump's far-reaching tariff agenda, which has raised U.S. import duties to levels not seen in over a century.\n",
      "The Trump administration claims tariffs will boost the U.S. economy in part by forcing manufacturers to move operations to the United States, and further by forcing U.S. trade partners to make concessions.\n",
      "But these global economic forces feel very far away from West Valley City, Utah, where tariff costs at Village Lighting are outpacing the company's expected profit margins.\n",
      "“The tariff costs in and of themselves are not sustainable, and I don’t believe we can raise the cost enough to the consumers to be profitable,” Jared Hendricks told NBC News during an interview at his warehouse in Utah.\n",
      "It’s an issue plaguing the entire Christmas decor industry, which for decades has relied on goods imported from Asia.\n",
      "American small businesses importing holiday decor this year have already spent more than $400 million on tariff fees, according to an estimate from a coalition of small businesses called “We Pay the Tariffs,” which counts Village Lighting among its members.\n",
      "Compared to the roughly $26 million these same companies paid in tariffs last year, that's an increase of at least 1,438%.\n",
      "Across the United States, companies of all sizes have tried to time their overseas orders in the hopes of avoiding the worst tariff fees.\n",
      "But for Village Lighting, which orders inventory up to a year in advance, this wasn't an option.\n",
      "After enjoying one of the company's most successful years ever in 2024, the Hendrickses decided to order extra inventory this year, a process that began last December and was completed by February.\n",
      "So when Trump announced sweeping tariffs on nearly all U.S. trading partners in early April, it was too late for the Hendrickses to cut back their orders, which were already loaded on container ships by the time the tariffs took effect.\n",
      "In an effort to keep their prices as low as possible, the Hendrickses have opted to absorb the majority of the added tariff costs.\n",
      "So far, that has cost them nearly $750,000 and counting. Tariffs are withdrawn directly from the couple’s bank account 30 days after each product arrives at a U.S. port.\n",
      "Their goal is to keep any retail price hikes under 5% this Christmas season.\n",
      "But the only way to do that, said Jared, was by “leveraging everything,” including their home, with a line of credit.\n",
      "“We went from working towards a profit to working for tariffs,” said Jared. “It’s affected our home life, our health. It has been the most stressful, difficult, challenging year of 23 years of businesses that we ever had.”\n",
      "This isn't the first time Village Lighting has had to contend with abrupt changes to tariff rates.\n",
      "During the first Trump administration, average U.S. tariff rates on Chinese imports swelled to around 20%, up from a simple tariff rate of just 2.8% in 2015.\n",
      "The Hendrickses responded at the time by attempting to diversify their supply chain across several Southeast Asian countries, including Indonesia, Cambodia and Malaysia.\n",
      "But these countries were all hit with high tariffs in early April of this year, swept up in Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariffs.\n",
      "At that point, said Jared, all his planning “went out the window.”\n",
      "Moving Village Lighting’s manufacturing operations to the United States would be nearly impossible, the Hendrickses say, because of the type of complex machinery and skilled labor that are required to make the Christmas goods they sell.\n",
      "“A dozen different factories go into one wreath or garland,” Jared said. “It’s not a matter of me opening up one factory. It’s a matter of me opening up two dozen factories and somehow providing a pathway to get raw materials.”\n",
      "He said that it was unlikely “that anyone in our situation could ever financially find a way to make that happen.”\n",
      "The Hendrickses are not alone in feeling the sting of tariffs this holiday season. Consumers are dealing with it, too.\n",
      "According to a recent survey from the National Retail Federation, 85% of shoppers expect to pay more this year because of tariffs.\n",
      "And they’re right — Lending Tree, an online lending marketplace, found that tariffs will cost the average American an additional $132 on their holiday expenses this year. Goldman Sachs estimates that consumers are picking up as much as 55% of overall tariff costs.\n",
      "The Hendrickses said they feel like small businesses are bearing the brunt of Trump’s tariff pains.\n",
      "“When there was Covid, it felt like the whole country was kind of in it together,” said Dawnita Hendricks. “This kind of feels like it’s just us against the failure of our business, because of something we cannot control.”\n",
      "That lack of control is clouding Village Lighting’s future.\n",
      "“After 23 years, you kind of start thinking about, What’s the second half of my life going to look like?” said Jared.\n",
      "“Are we going to be able to move to the next level so that we can retire and enjoy our grandchildren and whatever?”\n",
      "Tariffs, he said, “really just put a halt to that and made us question, ‘What’s next?’”\n",

      "Stocks across the board gained in Friday’s shortened session despite a CME Group outage that disrupted futures trading overnight.\n",
      "The Nasdaq-led gains were bolstered by chip stocks including Intel, Analog Devices and Micron Technology, and Magnificent Seven names like Amazon and Meta Platforms. Nvidia defied the trend, dropping 1.8% and capping a rocky month for the stock.\n",
      "This week’s upturn, which pushed the S&P 500 and Dow into the black for November, helped notch a seventh consecutive month of gains. That marks the blue-chip index’s longest winning streak since the start of 2018.\n",
      "CME said its derivatives markets reopened at 8:30 a.m. ET on Friday. Before then, traders hadn’t been able to buy or sell CME futures and options, including for U.S. indexes, Treasurys, gold and oil, due to cooling problems at a key data center. Analysts said the CME outage lowered trading volumes on what was already expected to be one of the year’s quietest trading days.\n",
      "Some investors are cautiously optimistic about the market’s next move, viewing the recent tech-driven decline as a welcome correction that has brought down the valuations of the more speculative market areas.\n",
      "“That was a healthy correction that burst a bubble and taught some investors that earnings, cash flow and valuation actually do matter,” said Jay Hatfield, chief executive at Infrastructure Capital Advisors.\n",
      "Global markets were little changed, with the Stoxx Europe 600 and Japan’s Nikkei 225 rising less than 0.3%. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng Index fell by a similar percentage. The European benchmark notched a fifth consecutive monthly gain, while the two Asian gauges ended November in the red.\n",
      "Shares of some U.S. retail chains rose, as shoppers flocked to snap up Black Friday bargains. Walmart gained 1.3%. The National Retail Federation forecasts a record 186.9 million people to shop between Thanksgiving and “Cyber Monday” on Dec. 1.\n",
      "Expectations for a Federal Reserve interest-rate cut next month, following signs the labor market is cooling, have bolstered markets. Fed allies of Chair Jerome Powell have laid the groundwork for him to push a cut through a divided committee. Traders have doubled their bets over the last week on a reduction to around 87%, according to the CME’s FedWatch tool.\n",
      "“Would a 0.25-percentage-point reduction in the federal-funds rate make a significant difference? Not by itself, but it carries important signaling value,” said Brian Jacobsen, chief economic strategist at Annex Wealth Management. “A cut could indicate not only that the Fed recognizes signs of a softening labor market, but—more importantly—that it is prepared to act in response.”\n",
      "Silver front-month futures jumped Friday, topping $56 per troy ounce and hitting a record high. Analysts attributed the surge to a supply squeeze, with Chinese inventories at the lowest level in a decade, as well as expectations for another Fed cut. Prices for silver, which holds value as both a precious and an industrial metal, have almost doubled this year. Gold futures also rallied Friday, settling at their highest level in over a month.\n",
      "The dollar held broadly steady against a basket of other currencies, after slipping earlier this week. Treasury yields edged up but remained around their lowest levels since late October.\n",
      "Bitcoin topped $92,000 before paring some gains. It has regained ground after sliding below $81,000 last week but remains far off its October peak above $126,000. Shares in Coinbase and bitcoin-buyer Strategy gained.\n",

      "Leading stablecoin issuer Tether has confirmed it’s shutting down its mining operations in Uruguay and is laying off most of its local workforce, after failing to reach an agreement with authorities over energy tariffs.\n",
      "Officials from Uruguay’s Ministry of Labor, according to local media, said Tether reaffirmed its decision during a meeting with the National Directorate of Labor. Out of 38 employees, 30 will be dismissed as the company winds down its presence in the country.\n",
      "Tether had planned to invest up to $500 million in Uruguay, including the construction of three data centers and a 300 megawatt renewable energy park. The stablecoin giant first started investing in sustainble bitcoin mining in the country back in 2023.\n",
      "According to its own account, more than $100 million has already been spent, with an additional $50 million committed to infrastructure that would have been handed over to the national grid operator, UTE.\n",
      "The company blamed high energy prices and regulatory hurdles for the pullout. Since 2023, it had requested a shift to a more competitive electricity rate structure, proposing to move from 31.5 kV to 150 kV transmission charges, according to local media.\n",
      "Tether argued that the change would benefit both parties by cutting costs and avoiding redundant infrastructure projects.\n",

      "FreightWaves \n",
      "FDX, UPS\n",
      "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/fedex-scrubs-md-11-flights-212022960.html\n",
      "Eric Kulisch\n",
      "Sat, November 29, 2025 at 4:20 AM GMT+7\n",
      "FedEx Corp. has canceled the December flight schedule for its fleet of MD-11 cargo jets, FreightWaves has learned, further signaling that federally-mandated inspections following the fiery crash of one of the planes early this month will take significantly longer than originally anticipated.\n",
      "The development dovetails with recent internal communications from UPS and Western Global Airlines, the other operators of the tri-engine MD-11, that their fleets are likely to be grounded for several months and be unavailable for the peak shipping season now underway.\n",
      "FedEx (NYSE: FDX) has scrubbed all MD-11 flights from the December schedule, according to an official with the union representing the company’s pilots and another person who is an MD-11 pilot. The decision makes clear the company doesn’t expect the plane to be available during the month and raises questions about whether the airline will again be without 8% of its main line capacity in January.\n",
      "“I don’t think this is going to be as short-term as people expected,” the FedEx MD-11 pilot, who asked for anonymity to prevent any employer repercussions, said in an interview.\n",
      "Following the deadly crash of UPS Flight 2976 in Louisville, Kentucky, the Federal Aviation Administration banned MD-11s from flying until the entire fleet is thoroughly inspected and any necessary repairs are completed. The National Transportation Safety Board on Nov. 20 said it found fatigue cracks in a structural section that held an engine to the left-wing.\n",
      "FedEx operated 28 MD-11s at the start of November.\n",
      "The level of regulators’ concern about the safety of the MD-11s is reflected by the fact that the FAA isn’t even issuing ferry permits for the aircraft so they can be flown from their current airfields to other locations for inspection or maintenance, according to the pilot source.\n",
      "FedEx pilots will get paid as normal for their December assignments, but exactly what the pay structure will be in the event of a January flight cancellation remains to be determined. There are about 500 MD-11 pilots at FedEx.\n",
      "The other source said the union has seen internal company emails indicating management intends to place MD-11 pilots on reserve duty in January, despite there being no defined flying or duty requirements at this time.\n",
      "“The association does not agree with applying reserve status and its related pay provisions in a circumstance where there is no operational need to be on reserve. We believe the situation would be best addressed through direct engagement between the company and the association to reach a solution that is appropriate and fair to both parties,” the union representative said.\n",
      "The FedEx Master Executive Council, part of the Air Line Pilots Association, is the bargaining unit for the express carrier’s pilots.\n",
      "“Safety is our highest priority at FedEx. We are working with Boeing and the FAA to address any required inspection and maintenance that may be needed to return our MD-11 aircraft safely to service,” spokeswoman Isabel Rollison said in a statement. “The flight schedules for December and January account for the MD-11s being currently grounded.”\n",
      "Meanwhile, UPS pilots have been informed that the inspection process, and possible repairs, for the MD-11s will likely take several months instead of a few weeks, as originally estimated, Brian Gaudet, a spokesman for the Independent Pilots Association, said Thursday evening.\n",
      "UPS (NYSE: UPS) employs 277 MD-11 pilots, according to IPA figures.\n",
      "The UPS pilots are pay protected, which means they will be compensated for flights they were already awarded in December and for future cycles, even if the fleet remains grounded, Gaudet explained in a phone call.\n",
      "The Louisville Courier-Journal, followed by other outlets, reported Thursday that UPS Airlines President Bill Moore conveyed in an internal letter that the MD-11 fleet will require more extensive inspections and potential repairs than first thought and the planes will remain grounded for several months.\n",
      "In his letter, Moore said Boeing’s ongoing evaluation of the aircraft model has led to the determination that removing engines and pylons may be necessary for “detailed inspections and repairs,” the Louisville paper said.\n",
      "Western Global Airlines has furloughed about 75 pilots who fly the MD-11 after learning from Boeing that the inspection process could drag out beyond this year.\n",
      "FedEx Chief Financial Officer, speaking at an investor conference on Nov. 11, said the inspection process was expected to be relatively quick and that the airline would return MD-11 freighters to service on a rolling basis after they passed safety checks and any required repairs. His comments came before the NTSB issued its preliminary accident report, in which it highlighted discovery of the fatigue cracks.\n",
      "The extended grounding of the MD-11 fleets could prove costly for the companies. FedEx and UPS, for example, have contracted with partner airlines to fill in a portion of the MD-11 flight schedules in their respective air networks.\n",

      "NTDOF\n",
      "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nintendo-secret-becoming-design-powerhouse-210000921.html\n",
      "Nicholas Gordon\n",
      "Sat, November 29, 2025 at 4:00 AM GMT+7\n",
      "Nintendo is home to some of the most beloved characters in the video game industry—Mario, Pikachu, Kirby, and many others. But inside the company itself is another cast of beloved characters—the army of developers that has stuck with Nintendo for most of their careers.\n",
      "“It’s almost impossible for any developer who is now of working age to have grown up without at least some influence from Nintendo,” says Keza MacDonald, author of the forthcoming book Super Nintendo: The Game-Changing Company That Unlocked the Power of Play, based off years of reporting on the company as a games journalist. “It is still, to this day, making games differently from everyone else.”\n",
      "Indeed Nintendo has largely sidestepped the graphics arms race that has bedeviled both its hardware and software competitors, instead focusing on what Game Boy designer Gunpei Yokoi affectionately termed “withered technology”: Using well-established technology and focusing on making something fun instead. That strategy has also allowed Nintendo to avoid the high costs and constant retraining that are hamstringing its  competitors.\n",
      "The Japanese game developer embraced “the principle of finding a playful way to design things that aren’t necessarily at the cutting-edge,” explains MacDonald, who currently writes about gaming for The Guardian. “That’s been a part of Nintendo’s philosophy since before it was even making video games.”\n",
      "The Japanese company has what MacDonald deems a “slightly conservative” approach, ensuring that it maintains healthy profit margins and builds up large reserves of cash. “Nintendo always operates with an understanding that its next product might not be a hit,” she says.\n",
      "Nintendo released the Switch 2, its latest video game console, earlier this year. While a few commentators griped that Nintendo’s latest version was just more powerful (and more expensive) than the last, gamers seem to have flocked to the new device. The company now expects to sell 19 million Switch 2 units by March 2026, the end of its fiscal year. The company reported 1.1 trillion Japanese yen ($7 billion) in revenue between March and September, more than double what it generated the same period a year ago. It also earned 199 billion yen ($1.3 billion) in profit, an 83% jump. Shares are up 46% for 2025 so far.\n",
      "Nintendo was founded in 1889 as a company making playing cards and eventually moved to making toys in the 1960s. It shifted to video games in the 1970s, and had its first hit with Donkey Kong, developed by Shigeru Miyamoto, who eventually designed beloved franchises like Super Mario and The Legend of Zelda.\n",
      "The game industry is known for its churn: Studios expand and contract according to changing demand. Around 10% of developers reported being laid off last year, and over 40% said they felt the effects of layoffs, according to a survey from the Game Developers Conference. “What that does is it robs companies of not just the knowledge, but also the security that helps people do their best work,” MacDonald says.\n",
      "Nintendo, on the other hand, has sidestepped this boom and bust cycle. The company revealed earlier this year that its Japan-based employees had an average tenure of 15 years.\n",
      "“The people who first made Nintendo’s hits are still working at the company,” MacDonald says. “For the last 50 years, these people have been passing down knowledge and training up a new generation of Nintendo creatives.”\n",
      "She adds that the company also rejects hierarchy when it comes to design. “It’s not like the oldest guy gets to decide what’s a good idea and what isn’t. Everyone puts ideas in.”\n",
      "Not all of Nintendo’s experiments work. Take the company’s Wii U console, released in 2012. Unlike its predecessor, the wildly successful Wii, the Wii U was a flop, selling barely 14 million units. Yet Nintendo took some of the design lessons from this failure and put them towards the Nintendo Switch—which, at 154 million units sold, is close to being the top-selling console of all time.\n",
      "That’s just one of the things that MacDonald thinks that other companies—and not just those in the gaming industry—can learn from Nintendo.\n",
      "“A failed idea is often a step towards the next hit you’re going to have.”\n",

      "A Brazilian fintech firm, Tanssi, is rolling out a government-backed blockchain project that involves microloans for farmers in São Paulo, following the pilot of a local currency in the town of Santo Antônio da Alegria.\n",
      "During an interview with CoinDesk at the Blockchain Conference Brasil in São Paulo, Tanssi’s Director of Business Development, Luis Dal Porto, revealed that the microlending service is set to be launched next month, with a mobile application for its use already being live.\n",
      "The project is backed by São Paulo’s city government and offers up to R$15,000 ($2,800) in fast loans to small-scale rural producers. The system runs on a blockchain infrastructure built with Tanssi, which lets developers create dedicated blockchains, or “appchains.”\n",
      "While blockchain technology is used in the service, it’s done so only on the backend.\n",
      "\"In practice, the blockchain isn't even seen. It is a mobile app that they offer to producers. They also have physical payment machines,” Dal Porto told CoinDesk. “It is an entirely closed ecosystem they offer to achieve more control of how the credit is used and to mitigate risk.”\n",
      "The fintech behind the project chose Tanssi over public blockchains like Ethereum or Solana due to concerns over performance and cost, Dal Porto added. With public funds involved, the team prioritized predictable transaction fees and reliability, two things that are harder to guarantee on public, permissionless networks, which have in the past experienced issues with congestion, volatile transaction fees and, in some cases, downtime.\n",
      "\"A classic problem with any public blockchain is that there are moments of bottlenecks, moments of more expensive transactions. This takes away something that is very important to them: predictability,” Dal Porto explained. “They need to have the predictability that they will spend that specific capital, and it won’t be more than that. If they charge 5% and, for example, if the fee goes up or down, it is a cost they cannot predict.\"\n",
      "Although Brazil’s central bank has paused full deployment of its Drex digital currency, the project’s backers expect municipal and private blockchain initiatives to continue growing in parallel.\n",
      "The Santo Antônio project was announced last year and uses a token system to distribute municipal aid, such as food benefits, through a closed ecosystem that restricts how and where the funds can be spent. The tokens, accessed via a mobile app or physical payment terminals, are programmed to block purchases unrelated to the aid’s intent, like gambling on sports betting apps.\n",
      "The São Paulo microloan program is expected to go live next month.\n",

      "The Amundi Funds Cash EUR fund now trades in a hybrid setup. Investors can purchase the traditional share class with cash or hold a tokenized version on Ethereum (ETH). The first transaction was settled on Nov. 4, the statement said. Amundi developed the product in collaboration with CACEIS, a European asset-servicing firm that provides the digital wallets and the platform for handling subscriptions and redemptions.\n",
      "Tokenization turns fund shares into blockchain-based records, which promises quicker settlement and a clearer audit trail. \"The fund uses distributed ledger technology and the public Ethereum blockchain to ensure transparent record-keeping of fund units and traceability of transactions,\" according to the statement.\n",
      "The development adds to Europe’s early lead in regulated tokenized funds. Firms in Luxembourg, France, and Germany have issued blockchain-native fund units for years, thanks to rules that provide asset managers with clear guidance on how to hold and record digital shares.\n",
      "CACEIS said that investors will be able to buy the fund through stablecoin or central bank digital currency (CBDC). \"With the new hybrid Transfer Agent service, our clients can quickly and easily benefit from a new distribution channel via blockchain to their investors,\" said CACEIS CEO Jean-Pierre Michalowski.\n",

According to the CME FedWatch Tool, the probability of a December rate reduction surged from a 37% chance earlier in the day to 70%.

      "The record-setting moves came amid low Black Friday trading volumes in the US following the CME disruptions. Spreads between what dealers and sellers would buy and sell gold for briefly surged earlier, signaling an illiquid market. As most trading operations resumed early in the US morning, futures on the London Metal Exchange extended their rally.\n",
      "Spot silver traded at $ an ounce as of  in New York. Gold rose  while platinum traded  higher. LME copper futures settled 2.3% higher in London after earlier hitting a fresh record of $11,210.50 a ton.\n",
      "Silver’s new high comes just over a month after a severe supply squeeze in the dominant trading hub in London last month, which sent prices soaring above levels in Shanghai and New York. While the arrival of nearly 54 million troy ounces has eased that squeeze, the market still remains markedly tight with the cost of borrowing the metal over one month hovering above its normal level.\n",
      "The flows into the London market have now put pressure on other hubs, including in China. Silver inventories in warehouses linked to the Shanghai Futures Exchange recently hit their lowest level since 2015, according to bourse data.\n",
      "“In the short term, a further price increase cannot be ruled out if registered silver inventories in China continue to decline,” analysts at Commerzbank AG wrote in a note earlier Friday.\n",
      "Traders are also monitoring any potential tariff on silver after the precious metal was added to the US Geological Survey list of critical minerals this month. While 75 million ounces have left Comex vaults since early October, fears of a sudden premium for US silver have caused some traders to hesitate before shipping metal out of the country.\n",
      "Silver has surged more than 90% this year, as investors pile into alternative assets in a wider retreat from government bonds and currencies, dubbed the debasement trade. Optimism about the metal’s fundamental supply-and-demand balance have also supported prices — the market is set to see a fifth consecutive supply deficit this year. Unlike gold, a large share of silver demand is industrial, with applications in solar cells and electronics.\n",
      "Copper’s latest leg-up comes after miners, smelters and traders met in Shanghai this week, with discussions focused on a tightening market. Kostas Bintas, the high-profile head of metals at Mercuria Energy Group Ltd., renewed his bullish prediction, warning that a rush to ship metal to the US risks draining the rest of the world’s inventories.\n",
      "“This is the big one,” he said in an interview at the end of an industry conference in Shanghai organized by the Center for Copper and Mining Studies, or CESCO. “If the world keeps going like this we will be left without copper cathodes in the rest of the world.”\n",
      "Traders have been ramping up shipments to the US in recent weeks to once again capitalize on a big premium for metal on the Comex, fueled by ongoing uncertainty about the potential for future tariffs.\n",
      "Friday’s surge is “a response to very bullish headlines coming out of CESCO Shanghai, focusing on the pull of US units into the country creating tightness ex-US,” said Natalie Scott-Gray, senior metals analyst at StoneX Financial Ltd.\n",
      "“This comes against a backdrop in which we already, for year-end, have a perfect storm bull narrative,” she said, citing the anticipation of tariffs, an improving macroeconomic outlook and supply disruptions.\n",
      "Copper has found further support in rising expectations of further monetary easing by the Fed, which could propel growth and demand in the world’s biggest economy.\n",

      "“It may take some time for a potential Ukraine-Russia peace deal to go through as Russia may look to store up some barrels instead of rushing to sell them,” said Mukesh Sahdev, the founder and chief executive officer of XAnalysts Pty, an energy market analysis firm.

      "Earlier this month, OPEC revised its Q3 global oil market estimates from a deficit to a surplus, as US production exceeded expectations and OPEC also ramped up crude output.  OPEC said it now sees a 500,000 bpd surplus in global oil markets in Q3, versus last month's estimate for a -400,000 bpd deficit.  Also, the EIA raised its 2025 US crude production estimate to 13.59 million bpd from 13.53 million bpd last month.\n",
      "OPEC+ at its November 2 meeting announced that members will raise production by +137,000 bpd in December but will then pause the production hikes in Q1-2026 due to the emerging global oil surplus.  The IEA in mid-October forecasted a record global oil surplus of 4.0 million bpd for 2026.  OPEC+ is trying to restore all of the 2.2 million bpd production cut it made in early 2024, but still has another 1.2 million bpd of production left to restore.  OPEC's October crude production rose by +50,000 bpd to 29.07 million bpd, the highest in 2.5 years.\n",

      "Xavier Vilajoana, a former board member of the club, told the Financial Times that striking a deal with the crypto startup was a sign of financial “desperation,” pointing to “red flags” in the company's background and calling the decision \"incredibly concerning.\"\n",
      "In a tweet, Vilajoana pointed to how ZKP's X account had only 33 followers at the time of the official announcement of the partnership, and he criticized the company’s alleged association with former kickboxer and controversial influencer Andrew Tate. Tate posted an endorsement of the Zero-Knowledge Proof technology on his X page, which was later shared by the company on its Telegram page, with an additional ZKP logo.\n",
      "“It seems like a bad joke, but unfortunately it's real,” commented Vilajoana.\n",
      "The club, which is thought to be under severe financial pressure, is holding €469 million of debt ($542 million).\n",
      "Zero-Knowledge Proof appears to have launched its social media channels and white paper early this November. Details about its ownership and funding structure aren’t clear from its website, though it says it is regulated under Samoan law. The firm is currently in the process of conducting its initial coin offering. ZKP’s namesake cryptographic technology has been possible since the early ’90s.\n",
      "The Financial Times noted that it was unable to find public information about some of the firm’s management, including Jeff Wilck, its head of blockchain.\n",
      "In an official statement, FC Barcelona said it “has no connection whatsoever with the company’s token,” and that the club hasn’t discussed the existence or issuance of this token during sponsorship discussions.\n",
      "“The club has no responsibility for, or involvement in, the issuance or management of this token, nor does it use the associated technology,” said the club.\n",
      "Harry Halpin, CEO of blockchain-privacy firm Nym Technologies, said he would be skeptical of any company “which appeared out of nowhere and claimed to provide privacy via zero-knowledge proofs.”\n",
      "What are Zero Knowledge Proofs?\n",
      "“There are only about 50 programmers alive, I suspect, who can actually understand the math and code production-ready zero-knowledge proof systems.”\n",
      "He added that most of them already work at established companies like privacy-centric Ethereum layer-2 Aztec, blockchain protocol Anoma, privacy-focused layer-1 blockchain Aleo, and the Electric Coin Company, which is behind the Zcash privacy coin.\n",
      "He also pointed out that zero-knowledge proofs in and of themselves don’t necessarily provide anonymity automatically, as the IP addresses of those involved may still be visible, hence the use of “mixnets” in some privacy-centric ecosystems.\n",
      "Decrypt reached out to Zero-Knowledge Proof for comment on the broad criticism of the company and FC Barcelona's statement, but did not immediately receive a response.\n",
      "\"No LinkedIn. No pitch deck. No press charm offensive. Just a new blockchain, deployed Proof Pods, and 100% self-funded,\" the company posted on X on Friday. \"Maybe what’s concerning trad media is that we skipped the PR game.\"\n",

      "A halt lasting around 10 hours triggered widespread frustration among market participants as they found themselves unable to trade contracts tracking the S&P 500 Index and multiple other assets ahead of month-end on one of the world’s largest derivatives exchanges. The outage stemmed from cooling problems at a crucial data center in the Chicago area.\n",
      "“I woke up thinking my Wi-Fi was out,” said Ritik Katte, chief investment officer at MCD Capital, a London-based investment firm.\n",
      "CME Direct, a platform the company offers for users to trade its markets, also eventually resumed operating after delays.\n",
      "The disruption lasted some three times longer than a similar disruption caused by a technical error in 2019 and underscores the reach of CME Group and its Globex electronic trading platform. Bourses operated by CME include the Chicago Board of Trade, the New York Mercantile Exchange and the Commodity Exchange.\n",
      "The cause of the outage was a cooling-system malfunction at a data center in Aurora, Illinios, according to facility operator CyrusOne, which is owned by KKR & Co. and BlackRock Inc.’s Global Infrastructure Partners.\n",
      "The Aurora complex has served as the primary hub of digital operations for CME Group for nearly two decades. The 450,000-square-foot facility is famous among high-frequency traders and Wall Street firms, who’ve jostled for position around the site to gain an advantage over competitors. Traders want to be close to the data center to minimize the distance data must travel in order to save microseconds.\n",
      "The disruption unfolded in the hours following the US Thanksgiving holiday Thursday, when stock and bond markets there were closed. While activity was expected to be subdued on Friday, a shortened trading day, the glitch added extra complications, particularly for investors looking to make month-end adjustments by rolling positions from one contract to another.\n",
      "“We’ve had to trade some cash Treasuries today and it was noticeably thinner and wider,” said James Athey, a portfolio manager at Marlborough Investment Management Ltd. “Month-end, day after Thanksgiving, CME down. It’s not an ideal combo!”\n",
      "The outage shows how one single point of failure can upend markets from commodities to foreign exchange and fixed income. It also raises questions about CME’s contingency plans and the exchange’s coordination with CyrusOne.\n",
      "Critical Decision\n",
      "While CME’s disaster-recovery plan includes moving to a data center in the New York area, the exchange opted to restart its matching engine from Aurora, according to a person familiar with the matter. The decision was made because the information the exchange had at the time signaled that the cooling issue would be resolved more quickly than it was, the person said.\n",
      "CyrusOne said in a statement earlier on Friday that its teams were working “around the clock” to respond to the cooling system issue but didn’t respond to more detailed questions about the outage and why the recovery was so prolonged.\n",
      "For markets affected, the impact was significant. In London hours, trading of US Treasury futures was halted, gold saw erratic moves and US crude and palm oil on the Bursa Malaysia exchange were also affected.\n",
      "Concentrated Markets\n",
      "Some traders reported that volumes had shifted onto alternative platforms as liquidity and price transparency evaporated.\n",
      "The disruption “shows how concentrated futures markets really are — there just aren’t many alternative venues for the main products,” said Thomas Texier, group head of clearing at Marex Group Plc.\n",
      "November has been a volatile month for equities, with the S&P 500 slumping as much as 4.7% amid concerns about the path of Fed rate cuts and valuations of artificial intelligence-linked stocks. The index has clawed back those losses and volatility has been falling all week, back near October lows.\n",

      "Visits to Black Friday sales have fallen this year as shoppers weigh up the prospect of higher taxes after Rachel Reeves’s Budget.\n",
      "High streets and shopping centres saw a 3pc decrease in foot traffic on Friday compared to a year earlier, according to data from MRI Software, in partnership with Retail Economics.\n",
      "“It is not surprising: people’s household budgets are under pressure and discretionary spending is an area that is bound to be hit,” said Richard Hyman, a retail analyst.\n",
      "“The fact that the Budget was so close to Black Friday means that consumers would have been bombarded by the various ideas that were floated ahead of the Budget. Whether that was income tax or mansion tax – people did not expect that they would have more money to spend after the Budget.”\n",
      "Black Friday is a US import and marks the beginning of post-Thanksgiving sales. It’s meant to kickstart the festive shopping season. It has become important for British retailers in recent years as shoppers have come to expect it.\n",
      "Traditionally held in October, this year the Budget fell just two days before Black Friday. Analysts said the timing was likely to have deterred people from shopping.\n",
      "Mr Hyman said: “The Budget’s proximity to Black Friday has not helped. It is a bit of a reality check and has helped to reinforce the idea that we are not doing very well economically. Consumers are part of that and so it does not make sense to go out and spend a lot of money in the Black Friday sales.”\n",
      "Retailers outside London suffered the biggest declines in visits to the shops, with coastal and market towns like Cromer in Norfolk and Shrewsbury in Shropshire faring the worst.\n",
      "Visits to high streets and shopping centres in London were largely unchanged from last year.\n",
      "The West Midlands saw a decrease of over 11pc while regions in the North including Yorkshire experienced a 10pc slump.\n",
      "“The cost of living squeeze appears to be weighing on overall activity,” said Jenni Matthews, at MRI Software.\n",
      "“Retail footfall remains 3.3pc lower compared to Black Friday last year with high streets and shopping centres leading this decline whereas retail parks noticed a marginal 0.1pc increase in visits.”\n",
      "BRC Consumer Sentiment Monitor data from earlier in November indicated subdued appetite for Black Friday sales.\n",
      "Only 42pc of respondents said they expect to spend more than they budgeted, down from 50pc in 2024. Overall, there was a decrease in appetite for the sales across the board with people saying they were less likely to take advantage of the discounts.\n",

      "The dollar index (DXY00) on Friday fell to a 1.5-week low and finished down by -0.08%.  The dollar gave up early gains last Friday and moved lower on increased chances that the Fed will cut interest rates at next month’s FOMC meeting.  Swaps markets now discount an 83% chance of a Fed rate cut next month, up from 30% last week, weighing on the dollar.  Strength in stocks on Friday also limited liquidity demand for the dollar.\n",
      "The dollar is also under pressure after Bloomberg reported on Tuesday that Kevin Hassett is at the top of the list of potential candidates to succeed Jerome Powell as US Fed Chair.  Hassett’s nomination would be bearish for the dollar as he is seen as a dovish candidate.  Also, Fed independence would come into question, as Hassett supports President Trump’s approach to cutting interest rates at the Fed, which Trump has long sought to control.\n",

      "EUR/USD (^EURUSD) on Friday rose by +0.05%.  The euro recovered from early losses on Friday and posted modest gains as the dollar weakened.  The euro also garnered support after the Eurozone’s Oct 1-year inflation expectations unexpectedly increased and the German Nov CPI rose more than expected, hawkish factors for ECB policy.  An unexpected decline in Friday’s German Oct retail sales report was bearish for the euro.\n",
      "Eurozone Oct 1-year inflation expectations unexpectedly increased to +2.8% from +2.7% in Sep, stronger than expectations of an easing to 2.6%.  Oct 3-year expectations remained unchanged at 2.5%, right on expectations.\n",

      "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ecopetrol-shoulders-load-petro-oil-193000469.html\n",
      "Julianne Geiger\n",
      "Sat, November 29, 2025 at 2:30 AM GMT+7\n",
      "Colombia’s Ecopetrol is pressing ahead with a 2026 spending plan of 22–27 trillion pesos ($5.9–$7.2 billion), essentially holding the line from this year despite a political climate that couldn’t be more hostile to hydrocarbons. The company says the money will be deployed “with discipline,” which in Ecopetrol-speak means: drill aggressively enough to keep the lights on, but not so aggressively that Bogotá accuses you of sabotaging the energy transition.\n",
      "The plan calls for 380–430 development wells next year, almost all in Colombia, plus a handful of exploratory wells. Around 70% of the total budget is earmarked for production, with Ecopetrol forecasting 730,000–740,000 boe/d in 2026 — basically the same level it fought to maintain in 2025 after hitting record H1 output of 751,000 boe/d. The kicker is that the entire plan is based on $60 Brent and a 4,050 peso exchange rate, both conservative assumptions that tell you the company expects no favors from the macro backdrop.\n",
      "The bigger story is what Ecopetrol’s spending says about Colombia’s bind. President Gustavo Petro has halted new exploration, banned fracking, and layered on new taxes that gutted foreign investment — all while proven reserves have shrunk to barely eight years of supply. Yet production remains the country’s main export earner and one of the last reliable sources of fiscal revenue. That contradiction leaves Ecopetrol doing the heavy lifting: sweating existing fields harder, squeezing lifting costs below $12/bbl, and leaning on U.S. Permian acreage to diversify away from Colombia’s political risk.\n",
      "The company’s partners have taken the hint. Foreign investment in Colombia’s oil sector has eroded for a decade, with majors scaling back or walking away entirely. Ecopetrol has responded by pursuing production-sharing deals on mature fields and doubling down on blocks like CPO-09, where its own finds are some of the few bright spots left.\n",
      "Ecopetrol’s 2026 blueprint isn’t trying to impress anyone; it’s a survival plan dressed up as a budget. The government keeps tightening the leash on exploration, reserves are shrinking, and foreign investors are jittery. Someone has to keep the barrels flowing, and right now that someone is Ecopetrol. The company is doing what it can with the ground it already controls: drill what’s drillable, squeeze every peso out of efficiency, and buy time for a country that hasn’t decided what should replace oil and still depends on it more than almost anything else.\n",

      "Business Insider \n",
      "No tickers found\n",
      "https://finance.yahoo.com/news/heres-big-name-hedge-funds-191412047.html\n",
      "Bradley Saacks\n",
      "Sat, November 29, 2025 at 2:14 AM GMT+7\n",
      "Hedge funds have been quick to use artificial intelligence to help their investing teams.\n",
      "The so-called smart money has also been quick to invest in the trend across public and private companies.\n",
      "Quant funds have used machine-learning techniques for years.\n",
      "Artificial intelligence has already changed the way many industries operate, and hedge funds are no exception.\n",
      "The $5 trillion field is diverse in the type of strategies different firms employ and the type of securities they invest in. But everyone wants to be the smartest manager in the world — or at least the best-informed.\n",
      "To do that, funds have pumped resources into building out generative AI capabilities and use cases. Many firms, especially quantitative traders, are expanding initiatives they were already pursuing in areas such as machine learning. And nearly every firm is putting capital behind the trend that has dominated the public and private equity markets for several years now.\n",
      "Business Insider rounded up how some of the biggest and well-known managers are leveraging and backing the development of AI. It's an extensive, but not exhaustive, rundown.\n",
      "It is, first and foremost, about the data.\n",
      "Hedge funds have spent countless hours and astronomical amounts of money to get more information than their rivals as fast as possible. Their insatiable appetite for new and unique data has created a thriving alternative data industry, which is filled with firms scouring the world for new information to sell.\n",
      "As Umesh Subramanian, the chief technology officer of Ken Griffin's $69 billion Citadel, said at a Bloomberg event in October, the data firms like his are now consuming is in petabytes. A single petabyte is 1 million gigabytes and can store hundreds of millions of photos or hundreds of thousands of high-definition movies.\n",
      "The only reason funds like Citadel are able to consume this amount of information without feeling overwhelmed is because of AI. And, given the hypercompetitive nature of the industry, even the slightest advantage over a competitor is worth the cost.\n",
      "\"It's an arms race to be able to consume the right kind of data in the right kind of way to be able to make the right decisions,\" Subramanian said.\n",
      "$29 billion hedge fund Balyasny has built an AI bot that it believes will be able to do the grunt work that typically falls to senior analysts — a potential huge timesaver for investment teams. The manager told Business Insider in 2024 that roughly 80% of the firm's staff use its AI tools, which include the internal chatbot BAMChatGPT, and recently hired Matthew Henderey, one of the CIA's AI developers, as a data science executive.\n",
      "Balyasny isn't the only firm that has its own chatbot. Man Group and Viking Global have also developed their own internal offerings.\n",
      "Quant funds like D.E. Shaw, Bridgewater, and Two Sigma and proprietary trading firms and marketmakers like Jane Street, Citadel Securities, and Hudson River Trading have been at the cutting edge of AI and machine learning for years.\n",
      "For example, Two Sigma's Mike Shuster, who is the head of the quant's core AI team, said at a Columbia University event in November 2024 that his firm had been using generative AI for more than five years at that point. Bridgewater launched a $2 billion fund in the summer of 2024 that is run by machine learning; the manager's CEO, Nir Bar Dea, said this year the strategy produces \"a unique alpha uncorrelated to what our humans do.\"\n",
      "To stay at the vanguard of a new technology, you need top talent. These firms have often been able to lure top technical talent with eye-popping pay packages, but AI companies have been able to match, and in some cases, surpass compensation offers.\n",
      "As Business Insider reported, young quants drawn to the work AI startups are doing now \"don't even have to take a pay cut\" to choose Silicon Valley over East Coast trading floors.\n",
      "One of the reasons AI startups like OpenAI and Anthropic can afford hedge-fund talent is the tens of billions of capital that have been invested into them by big-name venture capital firms, as well as Tiger Cubs like Tiger Global, Coatue, and D1. Tiger Cubs are hedge funds with connections to the billionaire Julian Robertson and his firm, Tiger Management, that often focus on growth stocks in industries such as technology.\n",
      "Stockpicking funds like the Tiger Cubs have increasingly turned their attention to the AI trend in the public and private markets. Stocks like Nvidia, AMD, and Korean chipmaker SK Hynix are often significant holdings in their public portfolios, alongside tech giants such as Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta.\n",
      "Maverick, a smaller Tiger Cub run by Lee Ainslie, focuses less on picking the winners and losers among AI players and more on supporting the chipmaking ecosystem. The firm's private fund, Maverick Silicon, which invests in that space, is run by one of the firm's longtime investors, Andrew Homan.\n",
      "Steve Cohen, whose $40.5 billion Point72 has dozens of teams that invest in equities, was so convinced by AI's potential that he created a standalone strategy in October 2024, named Turion, a play on the famous computer scientist Alan Turing's name, to invest in the space. Point72 rarely offers new funds outside its flagship.\n",
      "Turion, which is run by portfolio manager Eric Sanchez, has outperformed the manager's flagship offering in 2025.\n",
      "While some firms have turned over investing decision-making to AI, other industry leaders are not yet convinced that the machines can outperform the market.\n",
      "Citadel's Ken Griffin said at an October conference that AI can not yet beat the markets. Man Group's Numeric unit has created an internal \"large language model-based workflow\" called AlphaGPT that \"still requires human oversight and strategic direction.\" Elliott's Paul Singer said in a podcast at the start of the year that AI's use cases are \"way exaggerated.\"\n",
      "There's no doubt that funds are using AI more than ever before and processing more data than ever imagined. However, human creativity remains important for investment giants, and, for the most part, AI is seen as a tool, not a replacement, for flesh-and-blood traders.\n",
      "At a London quant conference in October, the conclusion many systematic funds reached is that humans, not machines, are the edge required to beat the markets, Business Insider reported.\n",
      "\"Our key takeaway so far is that AlphaGPT doesn't replace human judgment but amplifies it. The most effective use of the system involves human researchers working alongside AI, with each contributing their unique strengths,\" a pair of Man Numeric executives wrote in a note on AlphaGPT from earlier in November.\n",
      "\"Numeric Humans provide strategic direction, market context, and final decision-making, while AlphaGPT handles the heavy lifting of data processing, hypothesis generation, and initial analysis.\"\n",

      "Sugar prices settled mixed on Friday, with NY sugar posting a 5-week high.  Strength in the Brazilian real (^USDBRL) is supportive of sugar prices, as the real rose to a 1-week high against the dollar on Friday, discouraging export sales by Brazil's sugar producers.\n",

      "Sugar also has carryover support from Wednesday, when StoneX cut its Brazil 2026/27 Center-South sugar production estimate to 41.5 MMT from a September estimate of 42.1 MMT.\n",
      "Recent news that India's food ministry is considering boosting the price of ethanol used for gasoline blending is bullish for sugar, as it could encourage India's sugar mills to divert more cane crushing toward ethanol production rather than sugar, thereby reducing sugar supplies.\n",
      "Sugar prices have support from November 14, when India's food ministry said it would allow mills to export 1.5 MMT of sugar in the 2025/26 season, below earlier estimates of 2 MMT.  India introduced a quota system for sugar exports in 2022/23 after late rain reduced production and limited domestic supplies.\n",
      "On the bearish side for sugar, the International Sugar Organization (ISO) last Monday forecast a 1.625 million MT sugar surplus in 2025-26, following a 2.916 million MT deficit in 2024-25.  ISO said the surplus is being driven by increased sugar production in India, Thailand, and Pakistan.  In August, ISO had previously forecast a 231,000 MT deficit for the 2025-26 marketing year.  ISO is forecasting a +3.2% y/y rise in global sugar production to 181.8 million MT in 2025-26.\n",
      "The outlook for robust global sugar supplies has hammered sugar prices since early October.  On November 13, London sugar posted a 4.75-year nearest-futures low (SWZ25), and on November 6, NY sugar prices slumped to a 5-year nearest-futures low (SBH26), mainly due to higher sugar output in Brazil and talk of a global sugar surplus.  Sugar trader Czarnikow on November 5 boosted its global 2025/26 sugar surplus estimate to 8.7 MMT, up +1.2 MMT from a September estimate of 7.5 MMT.\n",
      "The outlook for record sugar output in Brazil is bearish for prices.  Conab, Brazil's crop forecasting agency, on November 4 raised its Brazil 2025/26 sugar production estimate to 45 MMT from a previous forecast of 44.5 MMT.  Unica recently reported that Brazil's Center-South sugar output in the second half of October rose by +16.4% y/y to 2.068 MT.  Also, the percentage of sugarcane crushed for sugar by Brazil's sugar mills in the second half of October increased to 46.02% from 45.91% the same time last year.  In addition, cumulative 2025-26 Center-South sugar output through October rose +1.6% y/y to 38.085 MMT.\n",
      "Signs of a larger sugar crop in India, the world's second-largest producer, are undercutting prices after the India Sugar Mill Association (ISMA) on November 11 raised its 2025/26 India sugar production estimate to 31 MMT from an earlier forecast of 30 MMT, up +18.8% y/y.  The ISMA also cut its estimate for sugar used for ethanol production in India to 3.4 MMT from a July forecast of 5 MMT, which may allow India to boost its sugar exports.\n",
      "The outlook for higher sugar exports from India is negative for sugar prices, as abundant monsoon rains may produce a bumper sugar crop.  On September 30, India's Meteorological Department reported that cumulative monsoon rainfall as of that date was 937.2 mm, 8% above normal, marking the strongest monsoon in five years.  On June 2, India's National Federation of Cooperative Sugar Factories projected that India's 2025/26 sugar production would climb +19% y/y to 34.9 MMT, citing larger planted cane acreage.  That would follow a -17.5% y/y decline in India's sugar production in 2024/25 to a 5-year low of 26.1 MMT, according to the Indian Sugar Mills Association (ISMA).\n",
      "The outlook for higher sugar production in Thailand is bearish for prices.  The Thai Sugar Millers Corp on October 1 projected that Thailand's 2025/26 sugar crop will increase by +5% y/y to 10.5 MMT.  On May 2, Thailand's Office of the Cane and Sugar Board reported that Thailand's 2024/25 sugar production rose +14% y/y to 10.00 MMT.  Thailand is the world's third-largest sugar producer and the second-largest exporter.\n",
      "The USDA, in its bi-annual report released May 22, projected that global 2025/26 sugar production would climb +4.7% y/y to a record 189.318 MMT and that global 2025/26 human sugar consumption would increase +1.4% y/y to a record 177.921 MMT.  The USDA also forecast that 2025/26 global sugar ending stocks would climb by +7.5% y/y to 41.188 MMT.  The USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service (FAS) predicted that Brazil's 2025/26 sugar production would rise by 2.3% y/y to a record 44.7 MMT.  FAS also predicted that India's 2025/26 sugar production would increase by 25% y/y to 35.3 MMT, driven by favorable monsoon rains and increased sugar acreage.  In addition, FAS predicted that Thailand's 2025/26 sugar production will increase by +2% y/y to 10.3 MMT.\n",

      "More than nine hours after the first alert appeared on the CME website on Thursday evening in the US, the company said services were starting to come back.\n",
      "During the outage, there was disruption to S&P 500 Index futures as well as the EBS foreign exchange platform and everything from Treasuries to US crude oil.\n",
      "In Singapore, one oil trader said when the initial alert was issued around 10:30 a.m. local time on Friday, they thought it was a hoax because the trades and quotes were still streaming in. But a few minutes later, the screen suddenly froze and they were booted out of the Nymex platform. A trader in London thought he had Wi-Fi connection issues.\n",
      "With the go-to service out, screens that would usually be a flickering wall of numbers ground to a halt, and traders had to seek out other options to keep trading and operating.\n",
      "“It’s pretty annoying. We wanted to price some equity index options,” said Gerald Gan, deputy chief investment officer at Singapore-based Reed Capital Partners. “My provider is scouring for alternatives, but I doubt the liquidity would be as ample as CME.”\n",
      "Such reactions reflect how CME — which started in the late 1800s as the Chicago Butter and Egg Board — has grown to become an integral part of the global market machinery and a crucial part of traders’ daily work. On average in October, derivatives trading volumes amounted to more than 26 million contracts every day, according to data from the group.\n",
      "On Nov. 20, open interest in CME’s US Treasury futures and options set an all-time high of 35.1 million contracts. About $1 trillion of notional value is traded daily in the E-mini S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100 futures alone.\n",
      "Exchange outages have occurred frequently in recent years, with technology issues affecting pricing across platforms globally.\n",
      "In June 2024, a glitch during a software update in June 2024 led the New York Stock Exchange to erroneously halt trading on about 40 stocks and display odd trades showing a 99% drop in prices. Earlier in the year, tech issues disrupted premarket Nasdaq trading for almost three hours.\n",
      "In Europe, London Stock Exchange Group Plc suffered three outages in a few months at the end of 2023.\n",
      "The latest CME malfunction is far longer than an hours-long outage in 2019, which will mean questions for the company about its contingency plans.\n",
      "On LinkedIn, one employee at commodity trader Glencore commented “Real Black Friday” in response to a post on the issue.\n",
      "Quiet Day\n",
      "Friday was expected to be a relatively subdued day for stock markets, with no US economic data scheduled and no Federal Reserve speakers.\n",
      "While some in the market said lower-than-normal liquidity because of Thanksgiving and half-day trading would limit volatility, there was also frustration about the challenges of trading without indications on US price action.\n",
      "“Given the shortened session, the lack of data today and little volatility in markets given yesterday’s holiday, you couldn’t have asked for a better day for this to happen as volumes would have already been light,” said Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group. “On the other hand, on a day when liquidity is already scarce, this only made getting trades done harder.”\n",
      "The outage meant limited trading in Treasury futures, and cash bonds traded sporadically. There are alternative methods to hedge trades, such as through swap markets, which became more active following the start of trading in London, according to traders.\n",
      "“I’m glad this isn’t happening on a ‘Liberation Day’ type event,” said Ritik Katte, chief investment officer at MCD Capital, a London-based investment firm.\n",
      "Futures for European and UK bond markets trade on a different exchange and were unaffected.\n",
      "In the foreign exchange market, one trader said when trading opened at 8 a.m. in London, some platforms initially showed elevated bid-offer spreads.\n",
      "“We typically use derivatives for tactical trades but it’s obviously impossible this morning,” said Amelie Derambure, a portfolio manager at Amundi SA. “Thankfully, it’s a quiet day. It would have been quite a handicap had it been a busy day.”\n",
      "Some said they were staying away given the risks posed by the outage on a day when trading was already expected to be thinner.\n",
      "“I am wary about trading on such an illiquid day, so I would not have wanted to trigger trades anyway,” said Rajeev De Mello, chief investment officer at Gama Asset Management. “And with this outage, all the more so.”\n",

      "Friday's fall in the dollar index (DXY00) to a 1.5-week low also sparked some short-covering in cocoa futures.\n",
      "Shrinking ICE cocoa inventories are also supportive of cocoa prices.  ICE-monitored cocoa inventories held in US ports fell to an 8.5-month low of 1,709,185 bags on Wednesday.\n",
      "An excessively short position by funds in London cocoa could exacerbate any short-covering rally.  Last Friday's weekly Commitment of Traders (COT) report showed funds boosted their net-short position in London cocoa futures by +3,737 to 22,748 net-short positions, the most in more than four years.\n",
      "The outlook for ample global cocoa supplies has weighed on prices.  Last Wednesday, cocoa prices tumbled to 1.75-year nearest-future lows on expectations of a bumper cocoa crop in West Africa.  Reports from Ivory Coast cocoa farmers stated that cocoa trees are doing well, and recent dry weather helped harvested beans dry, while cocoa farmers in Ghana said favorable weather is allowing cocoa pods to develop quickly.\n",
      "Chocolate maker Mondelez recently said that the latest cocoa pod count in West Africa is 7% above the five-year average and \"materially higher\" than last year's crop.  The harvest of the Ivory Coast's main crop has just begun, and farmers are optimistic about its quality.\n",
      "Cocoa prices are also under pressure after the European Parliament on Wednesday approved a 1-year delay to the deforestation law, keeping cocoa supplies ample.  The EU regulation, known as EUDR, aims to tackle deforestation in countries whose imports into the EU include key commodities such as soybeans and cocoa.  The delay of the EUDR will allow EU countries to continue importing agricultural products from regions in Africa, Indonesia, and South America where deforestation is occurring.\n",
      "Cocoa prices were undercut after the Trump administration announced on November 14 that it dropped the 10% reciprocal tariffs on commodities not grown in the US, including cocoa, and also the 40% tariff on food imports from Brazil.  Brazil is among the world's top 10 cocoa-producing countries.\n",
      "Reduced cocoa arrivals at ports in the Ivory Coast support cocoa prices.  Monday's government data showed that Ivory Coast farmers shipped 618,899 MT of cocoa to ports this new marketing year, from October 1 through November 23, down -3.7% from 642,500 MT in the same period a year ago.  The Ivory Coast is the world's largest cocoa producer.\n",
      "Weak global cocoa demand is bearish for prices.  On October 30, the CEO of chocolate-maker Hershey said chocolate sales this Halloween season were \"disappointing.\"  Halloween made up nearly 18% of annual US candy sales in 2024, second only to Christmas.  Meanwhile, the Cocoa Association of Asia on October 17 reported that Q3 Asia cocoa grindings fell by -17% y/y to 183,413, the smallest grindings for a Q3 in 9 years.  The European Cocoa Association on October 16 reported that Q3 European cocoa grindings fell -4.8% y/y to 337,353 MT, the lowest for a third quarter in 10 years.  The National Confectioners Association reported that Q3 North American cocoa grindings rose +3.2% y/y to 112,784 MT, but the addition of new reporting companies skewed the data.  In related news, North American sales volume of chocolate candy was down more than -21% in the 13 weeks ending September 7, compared to the same period last year, according to data from research firm Circana.\n",
      "A supportive factor for cocoa is lower cocoa production in Nigeria, the world's fifth-largest cocoa producer.  Nigeria's Cocoa Association projects that Nigeria's 2025/26 cocoa production will fall by -11% y/y to 305,000 MT from a projected 344,000 MT for the 2024/25 crop year.  In related news, Nigeria reported that its September cocoa exports were unchanged y/y at 14,511 MT.\n",
      "On May 30, the International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) revised its 2023/24 global cocoa deficit to -494,000 MT, the largest deficit in over 60 years.  ICCO said 2023/24 cocoa production fell by -12.9% y/y to 4.368 MMT.  ICCO stated that the 2023/24 global cocoa stocks-to-grindings ratio declined to a 46-year low of 27.0%.  On Friday, the ICCO estimated a 2024/25 global cocoa surplus of 49,000 MT, marking the first surplus in four years.  ICCO also said global cocoa production in 2024/25 rose by +7.4% y/y to 4.69 MMT.\n",

      "Stablecoin issuer Tether is halting its Bitcoin mining operations in Uruguay.\n",
      "The firm, which issues USDT, the third biggest cryptocurrency by market capitalization, said it made the decision to leave the South American country due to high energy costs.\n",
      "Local media reported that El Salvador-based Tether had confirmed to Uruguay's Ministry of Labor and Social Security that it was laying off 30 of its 38 employees in the country. The firm also confirmed the exit to Cointelegraph.\n",
      "Tether did not immediately respond to Decrypt's questions.\n",
      "Back in September, local media reported that Tether—which in October reported $10 billion in profit for the first three quarters of 2025—was in a dispute with Uruguay's government-owned power company UTE over a $5 million debt.\n",
      "Tether issues USDT—the most-traded digital coin in the crypto world, and the third-biggest digital asset with a $184.4 billion market cap.\n",
      "The token is dubbed a digital dollar: It is backed by reserves, according to Tether, that keep it at a 1:1 par with the US dollar. Cantor Fitzgerald, previously headed up by U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick's, currently custodies billions of dollars in assets that back Tether.\n",
      "S&P Downgrades Tether's USDT Stability to 'Weak' Due to Bitcoin Backing Concerns\n",
      "Traders in the crypto world can use USDT to quickly enter and exit digital transactions like Bitcoin buys.\n",
      "But Tether also wants to be the world's biggest Bitcoin miner, according to its CEO Paolo Ardoino.\n",
      "South American countries have been eyed up by Bitcoin miners due to their cheap energy. The crypto mining industry requires huge data centers full of expensive computers that use large amounts of electricity to process transactions on the blockchain and mint new tokens.\n",
      "Tether is making further inroads into Latin America after relocating to Bitcoin-friendly El Salvador in January. The company bought a majority stake in South American agricultural firm Adecoagro in March.\n",
