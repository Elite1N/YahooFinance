    "## Workflow Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "### Data Collection and Setup\n",
    "1. **Database Connection**: Establish connection to MongoDB and retrieve news articles\n",
    "2. **Model Initialization**: Load the FinBERT model for financial sentiment analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analysis Pipeline  \n",
    "3. **Data Processing**: Combine article titles and content for comprehensive analysis\n",
    "4. **Sentiment Classification**: Apply FinBERT to classify news sentiment (positive, negative, neutral)\n",
    "5. **Results Analysis**: Examine sentiment distribution and handle processing errors\n",
    "\n",
    "### Advanced Analytics\n",
    "6. **Ticker-Based Analysis**: Group sentiment by individual stock tickers\n",
    "7. **Temporal Analysis**: Examine sentiment trends over time\n",
    "\n",
    "**Model**: [FinBERT](https://huggingface.co/yiyanghkust/finbert-tone) - A specialized BERT model fine-tuned for financial sentiment analysis, providing superior accuracy for finance-related text."
